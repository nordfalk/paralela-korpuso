Nille .
I hardly believe there_ _s such another lazy lout in all the village as my husband , it_ _s as=much=as I can do to get him up in the morning by pulling him out=of bed by the hair .
The scoundrel knows to-day is market-day , and yet he lies there asleep at this hour of the morning .
The pastor said to me the other day , " Nille , you are much too hard on your husband ;
he is and he ought=to be the master of the house .
« But I answered him , » No , my good pastor !
If I should let my husband have his way in the household for a year , the gentry would_ _n't get their rent nor the pastor his offering , for in that length of time he would turn all there was in the place into drink .
Ought I let a man rule the household who is perfectly ready to sell his belongings and wife and children and even himself for brandy ?
" The pastor had nothing to say to that , but stood there stroking his chin .
The bailiff agrees with me , and says , " My dear woman , pay no attention to the pastor .
I pulled him out=of bed just now and went out to the barn to see how things were getting along , when I came in again , he was sitting on a chair , asleep , with his breeches -- saving your presence -- pulled on one leg ;
so the switch had to come down from the hook , and my good Jeppe got a basting till he was wide awake again .
The only thing he is afraid of is « Master Eric , » as I call the switch .
Hey , Jeppe , you cur , have_ _n't you got into your clothes yet ?
Would you like to talk to Master Eric some more ?
Hey , Jeppe !
Come in here !
Scene 2 Jeppe .
I_ _ve got to have time to get dressed , Nille !
I can_ _n't go to town-like a hog without my breeches or my jacket .
Nille .
Scurvy-neck ! Have_ _n't you had time to put on ten pairs of breeches since I waked you this morning ?
Jeppe .
Have you put away Master Eric , Nille ?
Nille .
Yes , I have , but I know mighty well where to find him again , if you do_ _n't step lively .
Come here !
-- See how he crawls .
-- Come here !
You must go to town and buy me two pounds of soft soap , here's the money for it .
But see here , if you_ _re not back on this very spot inside of four hours , Master Eric will dance the polka on your back .
Jeppe .
How can I walk four leagues in four hours , Nille ?
Nille .
Who said anything about walking , you cuckold ?
You run .
I_ _ve said my say once for all , now do as you like . [ Exit Nille .
] Scene 3
Jeppe .
Now the sow's going in to eat her breakfast , while I , poor devil , must walk four leagues without bite or sup .
Could any man have such a damnable wife as I have ?
I honestly think she_ _s own cousin to Lucifer .
Folks in the village say that Jeppe drinks , but they do_ _n't say why Jeppe drinks : I did_ _n't get as many blows in all the ten years I was in the militia as I get in one day from my malicious wife .
She beats me , the bailiff drives me to work as=if I were an animal , and the deacon makes a cuckold of me .
Have_ _n't I good reason to drink ?
Do_ _n't I have to use the means nature gives us to drive away our troubles ?
If I were a dolt , I should_ _n't take it to heart so , and I should_ _n't drink so much , either ;
but it_ _s a well-known fact that I am an intelligent man ;
so I feel such things more=than others would , and that_ _s why I have to drink .
My neighbor Moens=Christoffersen often says to me , speaking as my good friend , " May the devil gnaw your fat belly , Jeppe !
You must hit back , if you want your old woman to behave .
" But I can_ _n't do anything to protect myself , for three reasons : in the the first place , because I have_ _n't any courage ;
in the second , because=of that damned Master Eric hanging behind the bed , which my back can_ _n't think of without blubbering ;
and thirdly , because I am , if I do say it who should_ _n't , a meek soul and a good Christian , who never tries to revenge himself , even on the deacon who puts one horn on me after another .
I put my mite in the plate for him on the three holy-days , although he has_ _n't the decency to give me so much as one mug of ale all the year round .
Nothing ever wounded me more deeply than the cutting speech he made me last year : I was telling how once a savage bull , that had never been afraid of any man , took fright at the sight of me ;
and he answered , " Don't you see how that happened , Jeppe ?
The bull saw that you had bigger horns than he , so he did_ _n't think it prudent to lock horns with his superior .
" I call you to witness , good people , if such words would not pierce an honorable man to the marrow of his bones .
Still , I am so gentle that I have never even wished my wife dead .
On=the=contrary , when she lay sick of a jaundice last year , I hoped she might live ;
for as hell is already full of bad women , Lucifer might send her back again , and then she_ _d be worse than ever .
But if the deacon should die , I should be glad , for my own sake and for others' as=well , for he does me nothing but evil and is no use to the parish .
He_ _s an ignorant devil , for he can_ _n't sing a note , much less mould a decent wax candle .
Oh , but his predecessor , Christoffer , was a different sort of fellow .
He had such a voice in his time that he sang down twelve deacons in the Credo .
Once I started to quarrel openly with the deacon , when Nille herself heard him call me a cuckold .
I said , " May the devil be your cuckold , deacon !
" But what good did it do ?
Master Eric came right down off the wall to stop the quarrel , and my back got such a drubbing that I had to ask the deacon's leave to thank him , that he , as a well-educated man , should do such an honor to our house .
Since that time I have_ _n't thought of making any opposition .
Yes , yes , Moens Christoffersen !
You and the other peasants can very well talk , because your wives have_ _n't any Master Eric hanging behind the bed .
If I had one wish in the world , it would be either that my wife had no arms , or that I had no back .
She may use her mouth as much as she pleases .
But I must stop at Jacob=Shoemaker's on the way -- he_ _ll surely let me have a pennyworth of brandy on credit -- for I must have something to quench my thirst .
Hey , Jacob=Shoemaker !
Are you up yet ?
Open the door , Jacob !
Scene 4
( Enter Jacob=Shoemaker , in his shirt .
)
Jacob .
Who the dickens wants to get in so early ?
Jeppe .
Good morning to you , Jacob=Shoemaker .
Jacob .
Thank you , Jeppe !
You are up and about bright and early to-day .
Jeppe .
Let us have a pennyworth of brandy , Jacob !
Jacob .
With all my heart , when you show me the penny .
Jeppe .
I_ _ll give it to you when I come back here tomorrow .
Jacob .
Jacob=Shoemaker does_ _n't give credit , I know you must have a penny or two about you to pay with .
Jeppe .
Honestly , Jacob , I have nothing but what my wife gave me to spend in town for her .
Jacob .
You can easily beat them down a=few pence on what you buy .
What is it you_ _re to get her ?
Jeppe .
I have to buy two pounds of soft soap .
Jacob .
Why , can_ _n't you tell her the soap cost a penny or two more than you give for it ?
Jeppe .
I_ _m so afraid my wife would find out about it , and then I_ _d be in trouble .
Jacob .
Nonsense !
How could she find out ?
Can_ _n't you swear that you paid out all the money ?
You_ _re as stupid as an ox .
Jeppe .
That's true , Jacob !
I can do that well enough .
Jacob .
Out with your penny .
Jeppe .
Here you are , but you must give me a penny change .
Jacob ( coming in with the glass ;
drinks to him ) .
Your health , Jeppe !
Jeppe .
What a=lot you take , you rogue !
Jacob .
Oh , yes , but it_ _s the custom for the host to drink his guest's health .
Jeppe .
I know it is , but bad luck to the man that started the custom .
Your health , Jacob !
Jacob .
Thanks , Jeppe !
You_ _ll drink the other pennyworth next , so there_ _s no use your troubling about change .
Or do you want a glass to your credit when you come again ?
For I give you my word I have_ _n't any change .
Jeppe .
I_ _m damned if I do !
If it_ _s got to be spent , it might as=well be spent now , so=that I can feel I have something under my belt ;
but if you drink any of it , I will_ _n't pay .
Jacob .
Your health !
Jeppe .
God save our friends and ill befall our enemies .
That does my belly good .
Um-m-m.
Jacob .
Good luck on your way , Jeppe .
Jeppe .
Thanks , Jacob=Shoemaker . ( Exit Jacob .
)
Scene 5
( Jeppe feels happy and begins to sing .
)
A white hen and a speckled hen Got into a row with a rooster -- Oh , if I only dared drink another pennyworth !
Oh , if I only dared drink another pennyworth !
I think I_ _ll do it .
No , ill will come of it .
If I could once get the inn out=of my sight , I should_ _n't need to ;
but it_ _s as=if some one were holding me back .
I_ _ve got to go in again .
But what is this you are doing , Jeppe ?
I seem to see Nille standing in my path with Master Eric in her hand .
I must turn round again .
Oh , if I only dared drink another pennyworth !
My belly says , « Do it ; »
my back , « Don't . »
Which shall I obey ? Is_ _n't my belly bigger than my back ?
I think it is .
Shall I knock ?
Hey , Jacob=Shoemaker , come out here !
But that cursed woman comes before my eyes again .
If she only did_ _n't break the bones of my back when she beats me , I_ _d let her go to the devil , but she lays on like . . .
Oh , God help me , miserable creature !
What shall I do ?
Control your nature , Jeppe !
Is_ _n't it a shame to get into trouble for a paltry glass of brandy ?
No , I shall_ _n't do it this time ;
I must go on .
Oh , if I only dared drink another pennyworth !
It was my undoing that I got a taste of it ;
now I can_ _n't get away from it .
Go on , legs !
May the devil split you if you do_ _n't !
Marry , the rogues will_ _n't budge .
They want to go back to the inn .
My limbs wage war on each=other : my belly and my legs want to go to the inn , and my back wants to go to town .
Will you go on , you dogs !
you beasts !
you scurvy wretches !
The devil take them , they will go back to the inn ;
I have more trouble getting my own legs away from the inn than I have getting my piebald horse out of the stable .
Oh , if I only dared drink another pennyworth !
Who knows but Jacob=Shoemaker might trust me for a penny or two , if I begged enough ?
Hey , Jacob !
Another twopenny glass of brandy ! Scene 6
( Enter Jacob )
Jacob .
Hello , Jeppe !
back again ?
I thought you had had too little .
What good is a farthing's worth of brandy ?
That's hardly enough to wet your whistle .
Jeppe .
That's so , Jacob !
I_ _ll spend another farthing ! ( Aside .
) Once I_ _ve got it down , he_ _ll have to trust me whether he wants to or not .
Jacob .
Here's your farthing's worth of brandy , Jeppe , but money first .
Jeppe .
You certainly can trust me while I_ _m drinking , as the proverb says .
Jacob .
We do_ _n't give credit on proverbs , Jeppe !
If you do_ _n't pay up , you will_ _n't get a drop ;
we have sworn off trusting any one , even the bailiff himself .
Jeppe ( weeping ) .
Can_ _n't you really trust me ?
I_ _m an honest man .
Jacob .
No credit .
Jeppe .
Here's your twopence , then , you beggar !
Now it_ _s done , drink , Jeppe !
Oh , that goes to the right spot .
Jacob .
It certainly does warm a man's insides .
Jeppe .
The best thing about brandy is that it gives you courage .
Now I do_ _n't think any=more about my wife or Master Eric , I_ _ve been so changed by that last glass .
Do you know this song , Jacob ?
Heir=Peder and Kirsten sat at the table , Peteheia !
Said all the bad words that they were able , Polemeia !
In summer the happy starlings sing , Peteheia !
May devil take Nille , the dirty thing , Polemeia !
One-day I went out upon the grass , Peteheia !
The deacon , he is a hangman's ass , Polemeia !
On my dappled horse I ride to the east , Peteheia !
The deacon , he is a nasty beast , Polemeia !
If you would know my wife's real name , Peteheia !
I_ _ll tell you : it is Lust and Shame , Polemeia !
I made up that song myself , Jacob !
Jacob .
The devil you did !
Jeppe .
Jeppe's not as dull as you think : I_ _ve also made up a song about shoemakers , which goes like this :
The shoemaker sits with his big bass viol , Philepom , Philepom !
Jacob .
You poor fool , that_ _s about a fiddler .
Jeppe .
So it is .
See here , Jacob !
Give me twopence worth more of brandy .
Jacob .
All=right ;
I see you_ _re a good fellow ; you do_ _n't grudge spending a penny or two in my house .
Jeppe .
Hey , Jacob !
make it fourpence .
Jacob .
Certainly .
Jeppe . ( singing again ) .
The earth drinks water , The sea drinks sun , The sun drinks sea , Everything on earth drinks ;
Why not me ?
Jacob .
Your health , Jeppe !
Jeppe .
Mir zu !
Jacob .
Here's to you in half of it !
Jeppe .
Ich tank you , Jacob .
Drink , man , and the devil take you and welcome !
Jacob .
I see that you can talk German .
Jeppe .
Yes , I have for a long-time , but I do_ _n't like to except when I_ _m full .
Jacob .
Then you must speak it at=least once a day .
Jeppe .
I was ten years m the militia , do_ _n't you think I ought=to understand the language ?
Jacob .
I know , Jeppe !
We were in the same company for two years .
Jeppe .
So we were ; I remember it now .
You were hanged once when you ran away at Vissmar .
Jacob .
I was going to be hanged , but I was pardoned .
A miss is as good as a mile .
Jeppe .
It_ _s too bad you were_ _n't hanged , Jacob !
But were_ _n't you with us at the auction on the heath -- you know the one ?
Jacob .
Why , where was_ _n't I with you ?
Jeppe .
I never shall forget the first salt the Swedes made .
I think 3000 men -- or even 4000 -- fell all=at=once .
Das ging fordeviled zu , Jacob !
Du kannst das wohl rememberen .
Ich kan nicht deny dass ich bange war at dat battle .
Jacob : Yes , yes , death is hard to face ;
a man always feels pious when he goes against the enemy .
Jeppe .
Yes , that_ _s so .
I do_ _n't know how it happens .
For I spent the whole night before the auction reading the Qualms=of=David .
Jacob .
I wonder that you , who have been a soldier , should let yourself be browbeaten by your wife .
Jeppe .
I ?
If I only could have her here now , you_ _d see how I should drub her !
Another glass , Jacob !
I still have eightpence , and when that_ _s all drunk up I shall drink on credit .
In Leipzig war ein Mann , In Leipzig war ein Mann , In Leipzig war ein lederner Mann , In Leipzig war ein lederner Mann , In Leipzig war ein Mann . Der=Mann sie nahm ein Frau --
Jacob .
Your health , Jeppe !
Jeppe .
Hey !
he -- y !
he -- y !
Here's to you , and here's to me , And here's to all the company !
Jacob .
Will_ _n't you drink the bailiff's health ?
Jeppe .
Sure enough ;
give me credit for another penny-worth .
The bailiff is an honest man ;
when we slip a rix-dollar into his fist , he_ _ll swear to his lordship that we can_ _n't pay our rent .
Now I_ _m a villain if I have any=more money ;
you must trust me for a farthing or two .
Jacob .
No , Jeppe , you can_ _n't stand any=more now .
I_ _m not the kind of man to let his patrons force themselves to drink more=than is good for them .
I_ _d rather lose my trade than do that .
It would be a sin .
Jeppe .
Just another farthing's worth !
Jacob .
No , Jeppe , you can_ _n't have any=more .
Just think what a long way you have to walk .
Jeppe .
Cur !
Carrion !
Beast !
Scoundrel !
Hey , hey , h -- e -- y !
Jacob .
Good-bye , Jeppe !
Good luck to you !
[ Exit Jacob .
] Scene 7 Jeppe .
Oh , Jeppe , you are as full as a beast !
My legs do_ _n't want to carry me .
Will you stand still , you carrion ?
Let_ _s see , what time is it ?
Hey , Jacob , you dog of a shoemaker !
I want another drink .
Will you stay still , you dogs !
May the devil take me if they will keep quiet .
Thank you , Jacob=Shoemaker !
I_ _ll have another .
Listen , friend !
which way does the road to town go ?
Stand still , I say !
See , the brute is full .
You drank like a rogue , Jacob !
Is that a farthing's worth of brandy . . .
You pour like a Turk . ( As he speaks , he falls and lies on the ground .
)
Scene 8
( Enter Baron Nilus , Secretary , Valet , Eric , and another Lackey .
)
Baron .
It looks as=if we were going to have a good harvest this year ;
see how thick that barley is growing .
Secretary .
True , my lord , but that means that a barrel of barley will_ _n't bring more=than five marks this year .
Baron .
That makes no difference .
The peasants are always better-off in good seasons .
Secretary .
I do_ _n't know how that may be , my lord , but the peasants always complain and ask for seed-corn , no=matter whether the year is fruitful or not .
When they have something , they drink so much the more .
There is an inn-keeper who lives near here , called Jacob Shoemaker , who helps a good deal to keep the peasants poor ;
they say he puts salt in his ale to make them thirsty so they will drink more .
Baron .
We shall have to drive the fellow out .
But what is that lying in the road ?
It must be a dead man .
One hears of nothing but misfortune nowadays .
Run and see what it is , one of you !
Lackey .
That is Jeppe of the Hill , whose wife is such a terror .
Get up , Jeppe !
No , he would_ _n't wake even=if we pummelled him and pulled his hair .
Baron .
Let him be , then .
I want to play a little joke on him .
You are usually full of ingenious ideas .
Can_ _n't you think of something to divert me ?
Secretary .
I think it would be good fun to tie a paper collar round his neck , or=else cut off his hair .
Valet .
I think it would be more amusing to smear his face with ink and then send some one to see how his wife takes it when he comes home in that condition .
Baron .
That's not bad .
But what do you wager that Eric will_ _n't hit on something better still ?
Let_ _s hear your suggestion , Eric .
Eric .
My idea is that we take off all his clothes and put him in my lord's best bed , and in the morning when he wakes , all of us treat him as=if he were the lord of the domain , so he will_ _n't know how he has got so transformed .
And when we have convinced him that he is the baron , we can get him drunk again , as he is now , and lay him on the same dunghill in his own old clothes .
If all this is skilfully carried out , it will work wonderfully , and he will imagine that he had dreamt of his good fortune , or has actually been in paradise .
Baron .
Eric , you_ _re a big man and therefore you have big ideas .
But what if we should wake him in the process ?
Eric .
I_ _m sure we shalln't do that , my lord !
for this same Jeppe is one of the heaviest sleepers in the whole district .
Last year they tried setting off a rocket under his head , but when the rocket went off he never even stirred in his sleep .
Baron .
Then let us do it .
Drag him right off , put a fine shirt on him , and lay him in my best bed .
Act II
Scene I
( Jeppe is lying in the baron's bed with a cloth-of-gold dressing-gown on a chair beside him .
He wakes up , ruts his eyes , looks about , and becomes frightened ; he rubs them again , puts a hand to his head , and finds a gold-embroidered nightcap on it ;
Meanwhile , soft music begins to play , and Jeppe clasps his hands and weeps .
Jeppe . What is all this ?
What splendor ! How did I get here ?
Am I dreaming , or am I awake ?
I certainly am awake .
Where is my wife , where are my children , where is my house , and where is Jeppe ?
Everything is changed , and I am , too -- Oh , what does it all mean ?
What does it mean ? ( He calls softly in a frightened voice . ) Nille !
Nille !
Nille !
-- I think I_ _m in heaven -- Nille !
-- and I do_ _n't deserve to be a=bit .
But is this myself ?
I think it is , and then I think it is_ _n't .
When I feel my back , which is still sore from the last beating I got , when I hear myself speak , when I stick my tongue in my hollow tooth , I think it is myself .
But when I look at my nightcap , my shirt , and all the splendor before my eyes , when I hear the delicious music , then the devil split me if I can get it through my head that it is myself .
No , it is not me , I_ _m a thousand times a low dog if it is .
But am I not dreaming ?
I do_ _n't think I am .
I_ _ll try and pinch my arm ;
if it does_ _n't hurt , I_ _m dreaming .
Yes , I feel it ;
I_ _m awake , sure enough ;
no=one could argue that , because if I were_ _n't awake , I could_ _n't . . .
But how can I be awake , now that I come to think it over ?
There is no question that I am Jeppe of the Hill ;
I know that I_ _m a poor peasant , a bumpkin , a scoundrel , a cuckold , a hungry louse , a maggot , a lump of carrion ;
then how can I be an emperor and lord of a castle ?
No , it_ _s nothing but a dream .
So I_ _d better be calm and wait till I wake up . [ The music strikes up again and Jeppe bursts into tears .
] Oh , can a man hear things like that in his sleep ?
It_ _s impossible .
But if it_ _s a dream , I hope I may never wake , and if I am crazy , I hope I may never be sane again ;
I_ _d sue the doctor that cured me , and curse the man that waked me .
But I_ _m neither dreaming nor crazy , for I can remember everything that has happened to me : I remember that my blessed father was Niels of the Hill , my grandfather Jeppe of the Hill ;
my wife's name is Nille ;
her switch is Master Eric ;
my sons are Hans , Christoffer , and Niels . I_ _ve got it !
I know what it is ;
this is the other life , this is paradise , this is heaven .
I must have drunk myself to death yesterday at Jacob=Shoemaker's , and when I died I went straight to heaven .
Death can_ _n't be as hard to go through as they make out , for I do_ _n't feel a thing .
Now , perhaps the pastor is standing this very minute in the pulpit delivering a funeral sermon over me , and is saying , " So ended Jeppe of the Hill .
He lived like a soldier , and he died like a soldier .
" There might be some doubt as=to whether I died on land or on sea , for I was easily half-seas-over when I left the world .
Oh , Jeppe !
how different this is from walking four leagues to town for soap , lying on straw , being beaten by your wife , and having horns put on you by the deacon .
Oh , to what delights are your troubles and your bitter days now turned !
Oh , I_ _m ready to weep for joy , particularly when I think how all this has happened to me without my deserving it !
But one thing bothers me , and that is that I_ _m so thirsty that my lips are sticking together .
If I wanted to be alive again , it would be just=so I could get a mug of ale to quench my thirst , for what good is all this finery to my eyes and ears , if I_ _m going to die all=over again of thirst ?
I remember , the priest often said that man neither hungers nor thirsts in heaven , and also that a man finds all his friends there .
But I_ _m ready to faint with thirst , and I_ _m all alone -- I do_ _n't see a soul : I should at=least find my grandfather , who was such a fine man that he did_ _n't owe his lordship a penny when he died .
I_ _m sure lots=of people have lived as good lives as I have ;
so why should I be the only one to go to heaven ?
Then it can_ _n't be heaven .
But what can it be ?
I_ _m not asleep , I_ _m not awake , I_ _m not dead , I_ _m not alive , I_ _m not crazy , I_ _m not sane , I am Jeppe of the Hill , I_ _m not Jeppe of the Hill , I_ _m poor , I_ _m rich , I_ _m a miserable peasant , I_ _m an emperor .
O -- o -- o -- !
Help !
Help !
Help ! ( He roars loudly .
)
Scene 2
)
Valet .
I wish his lordship a very good morning .
Here is the dressing-gown , if his lordship wishes to rise .
Eric ! run for the towel and basin .
Jeppe .
Oh , worthy chamberlain !
I will gladly get up , but I beg of you , do_ _n't hurt me .
Valet .
God forbid that we should harm his lordship !
Jeppe .
Oh , before you kill me , would you do me the kindness of telling me who I am ?
Valet .
Does not your lordship know who he is ?
Jeppe .
Yesterday I was Jeppe of the Hill , but to-day -- Oh , I do_ _n't know what to say .
Valet .
We are glad that his lordship is in such good humor to-day as to deign to jest .
But , God help us , why does my lord weep ?
Jeppe .
I_ _m not your lordship .
I can take my oath on it , for , as far as I can remember , I am Jeppe=Nielsen of the Hill , and one of the baron's peasants .
If you will send for my wife , she_ _ll bear witness to it , but do_ _n't let her bring Master Eric along .
Eric .
This is strange .
What is the matter ?
Perhaps my lord is not awake , for he is not accustomed to joke like this .
Jeppe .
Whether I am awake or not , I can_ _n't say , but I do know and can say that I am one of my lord's peasants , who is called Jeppe of the Hill , and I never have been a baron nor a count in all my life .
Valet .
Eric ! what can this mean ?
I am afraid my lord has been taken ill .
Eric .
I imagine he is walking in his sleep , for it often happens that people get out=of bed , dress , talk , eat , and drink -- all while they are still asleep .
Valet .
No , Eric !
I think that his lordship is having hallucinations brought on by an illness , run quickly and fetch some doctors . ( Exit Eric .
) Oh , my lord , pray drive such thoughts from your head .
His lordship will otherwise strike fear into the whole household .
Does not my lord know me ?
Jeppe .
I do_ _n't even know myself , so how should I know you ?
Valet .
Is it possible that I should hear such words from my gracious lord's mouth and see him in such a plight !
Alas , our unlucky house , to be plagued with an evil spell !
Does not my lord remember what he did yesterday , when he went out hunting ?
Jeppe .
I have never done any hunting or poaching , for I know that_ _s a thing that will get a man hard labor ;
no living soul can prove that I ever hunted as much as a hare in my lord's woods .
Valet .
Why , my gracious lord , I was out hunting with you myself yesterday .
Jeppe .
Yesterday I was at Jacob=Shoemaker's , and I drank twelve pennyworth of brandy , so how could I have been hunting ?
Valet .
have the doctors been sent for ?
Eric .
Yes , they are coming immediately .
Valet .
Then let us put on his lordship's dressing-gown , for perhaps he might feel better if we took him out into the open-air .
Will my lord be so good as=to put on his dressing-gown ?
Jeppe .
With all my heart .
You may do what you like with me , so long as you do_ _n't kill me , for I am as innocent as a babe unborn .
Scene 3
( Enter Eric with two Doctors .
)
First Doctor .
We hear with the greatest sorrow that his lordship is indisposed .
Valet .
Yes , Doctor .
He is in a serious condition .
Second Doctor .
How are you feeling , gracious lord ?
Jeppe .
Splendidly , except=that I_ _m a=little thirsty from the brandy I drank at Jacob=Shoemaker's yesterday .
If some one would only give me a mug of ale and let me go , why then they might hang you and all the rest of the doctors , for I need no medicine .
First Doctor .
I call that pure hallucination , my good colleague !
Second Doctor .
The more violent it is , the quicker it will spend its rage .
Let us feel your lordship's pulse .
Quid tibi videtur , Domine Frater ?
First Doctor .
I think he should be bled immediately .
Second Doctor .
I do not agree with you ;
such remarkable weakness must be treated otherwise .
My lord has had a strange and forbidding dream , which has caused a commotion in his blood and has set his brain in such a whirl that he imagines himself to be a peasant .
We must endeavor to divert his lordship with those things in which he usually takes the greatest pleasure .
Give him the wines and the dishes that he likes best , and play the music that it pleases him most to hear . ( Cheerful music strikes up .
)
Valet .
Is not this my lord's favorite piece ?
Jeppe .
Like enough .
Is there always such merrymaking here in the manor ?
Valet .
Whenever his lordship pleases , for he gives us all our board and wages .
Jeppe .
But it is strange I can_ _n't remember the things I have done before .
Second Doctor .
It is the result of this illness , your lordship , that one forgets all he has done previous to it .
I remember , a=few years ago , one of my neighbors became so confused after drinking heavily that for two days he thought he had no head .
Jeppe .
I wish Squire Christoffer would do that ;
he must have an illness that works just the other way , for he thinks he has a great big head , while he really has_ _n't got one at=all , as any one can tell from his decisions . ( All laugh .
)
Second Doctor .
It is a great pleasure to us to hear his lordship jest .
But to return to my story , this fellow went all=over the town asking people if they had found the head he had lost ;
he recovered , however , and is now a sexton in Jutland .
Jeppe .
He could be that even=if he had_ _n't found his head . ( All laugh again .
)
First Doctor .
Does my honored colleague remember the case that occurred ten years ago , of the man who thought his head was full of flies ?
He could not get over the notion , no=matter how much they argued with him , until a clever doctor cured him in this way : he put on his head a plaster which was covered with dead flies , and after a while took it off and showed the flies on it to the patient , who thought they had been drawn out=of his head , and was immediately well again .
I also have heard of another man who , after a long fever , got the idea that if he made water the country would suffer from a flood .
No one could make him think otherwise ;
he said he was willing to die for the common good .
This is how he was cured : a message was sent to him , supposedly from the commandant , saying that the town was threatened with a siege and there was no water in the moat , and asking him to fill it to keep the enemy out .
The patient was delighted to be able to save both his fatherland and himself ;
so he got rid of his water and of his sickness both at=once .
Second Doctor .
I recall another case that occurred in Germany .
A nobleman came to an inn , and when he had dined and wanted to go to bed , he hung the gold chain which he wore round his neck on a nail in the wall of the bedroom .
The innkeeper took careful note of this as he followed him to bed and wished him good-night .
When he thought that the nobleman was asleep , he stole into the room , cut sixty links out=of the chain , and hung it up again .
The guest got up in the morning , had his horse saddled , and put on his clothes .
But when he came to put on the chain , he noticed that it had lost half its length , and began to call out that he had been robbed .
The host , who was watching outside the door , ran in , putting on an expression of the greatest consternation , and exclaimed , " Oh , what a terrible transformation !
" When the guest asked him what he meant by that , he said , " Alas , my lord !
your head is as big again as it was yesterday .
" Then the host brought him a distorting mirror , which made everything appear twice as big as it really was .
When the nobleman saw how big his head looked in the mirror , he burst into tears and said , « Oh,=now=I=see=why=my=chain=will=not=go=on ! »
Whereupon he mounted his horse , wrapping his head in his cloak , that none might see it on the road .
They say that he kept the house for several days , unable to get over the idea that it was not the chain that had grown too short , but his head that had grown too big .
First Doctor .
There are countless examples of such illusions .
I also remember hearing of a man who imagined his nose was ten feet long , and warned every one he met not to come too near .
Second Father .
Domine Frater has undoubtedly heard the story of the man who thought he was dead ?
A young person got it into his head that he was dead , and consequently laid himself out on a bier , and would neither eat nor drink .
His friends endeavored to show him the absurdity of his conduct and tried every means of making him eat , but in vain , for he merely dismissed them with scorn , asserting that it was contrary=to all rule for the dead to eat and drink .
At=last an experienced physician undertook to cure him by this unusual method : He got a servant to pretend that he too was dead , and had him laid out in the same place with the patient .
For a long time the two lay and looked at each=other .
After a while the patient began to ask the other man what he was doing there , and he answered that he was dead .
Then they began to question each=other as=to how they had died , and both explained in full .
Later , some people who had been instructed what to do came and brought the second man his supper , whereupon he sat up in his coffin and ate a hearty meal , saying to the other , « Are_ _n't=you=going=to=eat=pretty=soon ? »
The sick man pondered over this , and asked if it was proper for a dead man to eat , and was answered that if he did not eat soon , he could not stay dead very long .
He therefore allowed himself to be persuaded first to eat with the other man , subsequently to sleep , get up , dress , -- in fact , in all matters copy the other , until finally he came to life and regained his senses .
I could give innumerable other examples of such odd illusions .
That is just what has happened in this case to make his gracious lordship think that he is a poor peasant .
But if my lord will get the notion out=of his head , he will speedily be himself again .
Jeppe .
But can it be only illusion ?
First Doctor .
Certainly ;
my lord has heard from these stories what illusions can do .
Jeppe .
Am I not Jeppe of the Hill ?
First Doctor .
Certainly not .
Jeppe .
Is_ _n't that wicked Nille my wife ?
First Doctor .
By=no=means , for my lord is a widower .
Jeppe .
Is it pure illusion that she has a switch called Master Eric ?
First Doctor .
Pure illusion .
Jeppe .
Is_ _n't it true either that I was to go to town yesterday and buy soap ?
First Doctor .
No.
Jeppe .
Nor that I drank up the money at Jacob=Shoemaker's ?
Valet .
Why , your lordship was with us out hunting all day yesterday .
Jeppe .
Nor that I am a cuckold ?
Valet .
Why , her ladyship has been dead for years .
Jeppe .
I_ _m beginning to realize my own stupidity .
I will_ _n't think about the peasant any=more ;
I see that it was a dream that led me into my delusion .
It certainly is wonderful how men get such ideas .
Valet .
Does my lord wish to walk in the garden for a time while we make ready his breakfast ?
Jeppe .
Very well ;
but hurry up , for I am both hungry and thirsty .
Act III
Scene I
( Jeppe comes in from the garden with his suite .
A small table is set .
)
Jeppe .
Ah , ha !
I see that the table is all set .
Valet .
Yes , everything is ready when his lordship wishes to be seated .
( Jeppe sits down .
The others stand behind his chair and laugh at his bad manners when he sticks all five fingers in the dish , belches , and blows his nose with his fingers and wipes them on his clothes .
)
Valet .
Will my lord order what wine he desires ?
Jeppe .
You know yourself what wine I usually drink in the morning .
Valet .
Here is Rhine-wine , which my lord usually drinks .
But if this does_ _n't suit his lordship's taste , he can have something=else immediately .
Jeppe .
That's a little too sour .
Put some mead in it , and it will be all=right ;
I am for sweet things . Valet .
Here is some port-wine , if my lord would like to taste it .
Jeppe .
That's fine wine .
) Hurry up , lad !
another glass of pork-wine . Do you understand ?
-- Where did you get that ring on your finger ?
Secretary .
My lord gave it to me himself .
Jeppe .
I do_ _n't remember it ;
give it back to me .
I must have been drunk when I did it .
A man does_ _n't give away rings like that for nothing .
Later on I_ _ll look into things and see what else you_ _ve got away with .
Servants ought not to get anything more=than board and wages .
I can swear I do_ _n't remember making you any special present ;
why should I ?
That ring must be worth more=than ten rix-dollars .
No , no , my good fellows !
That will_ _n't do at=all .
You must not take advantage of your master's feebleness and drunkenness .
When I_ _m drunk , I_ _m perfectly ready to give away my breeches ;
but when I have slept off my liquor , I take back my gifts .
Otherwise I should get into trouble with Nille , my old woman .
But what am I saying ?
I am falling back into my mad notions again and do_ _n't realize who I am .
Give me another glass of pork-wine .
More noise ! ( Trumpets .
) Pay attention to what I say , lads .
I want you to understand that after this , if I give anything away in the evening when I_ _m drunk and you do_ _n't bring it back in the morning , you will have to answer for it .
When servants are given more=than they can eat , they get proud and turn up their noses at the master .
What wages do you get ?
Secretary .
My lord has heretofore given me two hundred rix-dollars a year .
Jeppe .
The devil a two hundred you get after this !
What do you do to earn two hundred rix-dollars ?
I myself have to slave-like a beast , and be on my feet in the hay loft from morning till night , and can scarcely -- See how I come back to my cursed peasant notions .
Give me another glass of wine . ( He drinks ;
trumpets blow again .
) Two-hundred rix-dollars !
Why , that_ _s pulling the very hide off your master .
Listen , do you know what , you good lads ?
When I have dined , I have a good mind to hang half you fellows here on the estate .
You_ _ll find out that I am not to be trifled with in money matters .
Valet .
We will give back all that we have received from his lordship .
Jeppe .
Yes , yes , « his lordship » this , « his lordship » that !
We get compliments and ceremonies cheap enough nowadays .
You want to flatter me with « his lordship » until you_ _ve got all my money away from me and you are the lordships yourselves .
Your mouths say " his lordship , « but your hearts say » his foolship .
" You do_ _n't say what you mean , my lads .
You servants are like Abner when he came and greeted Roland , saying , « Hail,=brother , » and so saying thrust a dagger into his heart .
) Get up , lads !
Wait till I have finished eating .
Then I shall see how it works out and decide which of you deserve to be hanged and which do_ _n't .
For the present I shall make merry . Scene 2 Jeppe .
Where is my bailiff ?
Valet .
He is waiting outside .
Jeppe .
Tell him to come in immediately .
[ Enter the Bailiff in a coat with silver buttons and a sword-belt over his shoulder . ] Bailiff .
Has his lordship any orders ?
Jeppe .
Only that you are to be hanged .
Bailiff .
I have surely done no wrong , my lord !
Why should I be hanged ?
Jeppe .
Are you not the bailiff ?
Bailiff .
Yes , indeed , your lordship .
Jeppe .
And yet you ask why you should be hanged ?
Bailiff .
I have served your lordship so honestly and faithfully and have been so diligent in my office that your lordship has always praised me more=than any other of his servants .
Jeppe .
Indeed , you have been diligent in your office , as your solid silver buttons plainly show .
What wages do you get ?
Bailiff .
Fifty rix-dollars a year .
Jeppe [ gets up and walks to=and=fro ] . Fifty ?
You surely shall be hanged .
Bailiff .
It could_ _n't well be less , my lord , for a whole year's hard work .
Jeppe .
That's just the reason you are to be hanged -- because you only get fifty rix-dollars .
You have money enough for a coat with silver buttons , frills at your wrists , and a silk queue for your hair -- and all on fifty rix-dollars a year .
If you did_ _n't rob me , poor man , where else could you get it ?
Bailiff [ on his knees ] .
Oh , gracious lord !
For=the=sake=of my unfortunate wife and innocent children , spare me !
Jeppe .
Have you many children ?
Bailiff .
Seven children living , my lord .
Jeppe .
Ha ! Ha !
Seven children living !
Have him hanged immediately , Sectary .
Secretary .
Oh , gracious lord , I am no hangman .
Jeppe .
If you_ _re not , you can soon learn to be .
You look fit for any trade .
And when you have hanged him , I shall have you hanged yourself .
Bailiff .
Oh , gracious lord , is there no reprieve ?
Half a hundred rix-dollars , a wife and seven children .
If no=one else will hang you , I_ _ll do it myself .
I know what sort you are , you bailiffs !
I know how you have cheated me and other miserable peasants -- Oh , there come those damned peasant illusions into my head again .
I meant to say , that I know your games and your goings-on so well , I could be a bailiff myself if I had to .
You get the cream off the milk , and your master gets dung , to speak modestly .
I really think that if the world keeps on , the bailiffs will all be noblemen and the noblemen all bailiffs .
Take my word for it , lad !
I_ _m not going to let myself be fooled in that way , for I_ _m a peasant and a peasant's son myself -- see how that illusion keeps cropping up !
I was about to say that I am a peasant's son myself , for Abraham and Eve , our first parents , were tillers of the soil .
Secretary [ on his knees ] .
Oh , gracious lord !
Pray take pity on him for=the=sake=of his unfortunate wife ;
for how can she live if he is not there to feed her and the children ?
Jeppe .
Who says they should live either ?
We can string them up along with him .
Secretary .
Oh , my lord !
she is such a lovely , beautiful woman .
Jeppe .
So ?
Perhaps you are her lover , seeing you feel so badly about her .
Send her here .
Scene 3 [ Enter Bailiff's wife ;
she kisses Jeppe's band . ]
Jeppe .
Are you the bailiff's wife ?
Wife .
Yes , your lordship , I am .
You are pretty .
Would you like to sleep with me to-night ?
Wife .
My lord has only to command , for I am his servant .
Jeppe [ to the Bailiff ] .
Do you consent to my lying with your wife to-night ?
Bailiff .
I thank his lordship for doing my humble house the honor .
Jeppe .
Here !
Bring her a chair ;
He becomes jealous of the Secretary .
] You_ _ll get into trouble , if you look at her like that . [ Whenever he looks at the Secretary , the Secretary takes his eyes off the woman and gazes at the floor .
Jeppe sings an old love-ballad as he sits at the table with her .
He orders a polka to be played and dances with her , but he is so drunk that he falls down three-times , and finally lies where he falls and goes to sleep .
]
Scene 4 ( Enter the Baron and Eric . ) Baron .
He is sound asleep .
Now we have played our game , but we have nearly been made the bigger fools ourselves , for he intended to tyrannize over us , so=that we must either have spoiled our trick , or else have let ourselves be mauled by the rude yokel , from whose conduct one can learn how haughty and overbearing such people become when they suddenly rise from the mire to a station of worth and honor .
If I had , in an unlucky moment , impersonated a secretary myself , I might have got a thrashing , and the whole affair would have been a failure , for people would have laughed more at me than at the peasant .
We had better let him sleep awhile before we put him back into his dirty farm clothes again .
Eric .
Why , my lord , he is sleeping like a log ;
look , I can pound him and he does_ _n't feel it .
Baron .
Take him out , then , and complete our little comedy .
Act IV
Scene 1
[ Jeppe is lying on a dungheap in his old peasant clothes .
He wakes and calls out . ]
Jeppe .
Hey , Sectary , Valet , Lackeys !
another glass of pork-wine ! [ He looks about him , rubs his eyes as before , feels his head , and finds his old broad-brimmed hat on it ; rubs his eyes again , turns the hat over=and=over , looks at his clothes , recognizes himself again , and begins to talk .
] How long was Abraham in paradise ?
Now , alas , I recognize everything again -- my bed , my jacket , my old cuckold-hat , myself ;
this is different , Jeppe , from drinking pork-wine out=of a gilt-edged glass , and sitting at a table with lackeys and a sectary behind my chair .
Good fortune , worse luck , never lasts very long .
Oh , that I , who such a short time ago was « my lord , » should now find myself in such a miserable plight , with my fine bed turned into a dungheap , my gold-embroidered cap changed into my old cuckold-hat , my lackeys into pigs , and I myself from « my lord » to a wretched peasant once=more !
I thought when I woke up again I should find my fingers covered with gold rings , but , saving your presence , they_ _re covered with something very different .
I thought I should be calling servants to account , but now I must get my back ready for my home-coming , when I shall have to give an account of my own doings .
I thought that when I woke up I should reach out and grasp a glass of pork-wine , but instead , to speak modestly , I get a handful of dung .
Alas , Jeppe , your sojourn in paradise was pretty short , and your happiness came quickly to an end .
But who knows that the same thing might not happen again if I were to lie down for a while ?
Oh , if it only would !
Oh , if I could get back there again ! [ Lies down and goes to sleep .
]
Scene 2 [ Enter Nille .
] Nille .
I wonder if anything has happened to him ?
What could it be ?
Either the devil has taken him , or , what I fear more , he_ _s sitting at an inn drinking up the money .
I was a goose to trust the drunkard with twelve pence at=once .
But what do I see ?
Is_ _n't that himself lying there in the filth and snoring ?
Oh , miserable mortal that I am , to have such a beast for a husband !
Your back will pay dearly for this ! [ She steals up=to him and gives him a whack on the rump with Master Eric .
]
Jeppe .
Hey , hey !
Help , help !
What is that ?
Where am I ?
Who am I ? Who is beating me ?
and why ?
Hey !
Nille .
I_ _ll teach you what it is soon enough . [ Beats him and pulls his hair .
]
Jeppe .
Oh , dear Nille , do_ _n't beat me any=more ;
you do_ _n't know-all that has happened to me .
Nille .
Where have you been all this time , you guzzler ?
Where is the soap you were to buy ?
Jeppe .
I could_ _n't get to town , Nille .
Nille .
Why not ?
Jeppe .
I was taken up=to paradise on the way .
Nille .
To paradise ! [ Hits him .
] To paradise . [ Hits him again .
] Are you going to make sport of me into the bargain ?
Jeppe .
O -- o -- o -- !
As true as I_ _m an honest man , it_ _s so !
Nille .
What's so ?
Jeppe .
] Oh , Nille , dear , do_ _n't beat me !
Nille .
Quick , confess where you_ _ve been , or I_ _ll trounce the life out=of you .
Jeppe .
Oh , I_ _ll confess , if you will_ _n't beat me any=more .
Nille .
Go on , confess .
Jeppe .
Swear not to beat me ?
Nille .
No.
Jeppe .
As true as I_ _m an honest man called Jeppe of the Hill , as sure as that_ _s true , I have been in paradise and have seen things that it will stun you to hear of .
[ Nille beats him again and drags him into the house by the hair .
]
Scene 3 [ Enter Nille .
] Nille .
Now , then , you drunken hound !
Sleep off your liquor first ;
then we shall have more to say about it .
Such swine as you do_ _n't go to paradise !
Think of it , the beast has drunk himself clean out=of his wits .
But if he did it at my expense , then he_ _ll do heavy penance for it ;
he shall_ _n't get a thing to eat or drink for two whole days .
By that time he_ _ll get over his notions about paradise .
Scene 4
( Enter three armed men .
)
First Man .
Does a man named Jeppe live here ?
Nille .
Yes , he does .
First Man .
Are you his wife ?
Nille .
Yes , God help me , so much the worse for me .
First Man .
We must go in and talk with him .
Nille .
He_ _s dead-drunk .
First Man .
That makes no difference ;
fetch him out or the whole household will suffer .
[ Nille goes in , and pushes Jeppe out so hard that he knocks over one of the men and rolls on the ground with him .
]
Scene 5
Jeppe .
Now , good friends , you see what a wife I have to put up with .
First Man .
You deserve no better , for you_ _re a malefactor .
Jeppe .
What have I done now ?
First Man .
Scene 6
( Enter the Judge , followed by two Lawyers .
He sits down .
Jeppe , his hands tied behind him , is brought to the bar .
One of his captors steps forward .
)
First Man .
Here is a man , your honor , whom we can swear to have seen sneaking into the baron's house , where he posed as his lordship , put on his clothes , and tyrannized over the servants .
As this is a piece of unheard-of impudence , we demand on=behalf=of his lordship that it be punished with such severity that it shall serve as=an=example and a warning to other evil-doers .
Judge .
Is this accusation true ?
Speak out whatever you may have to say in answer to it , for we do not wish to convict any one unheard .
Jeppe .
Alas , what a God-forsaken man I am !
What can I say ?
I admit I deserve punishment , but only for the money I squandered on drink instead=of buying soap with it .
I also admit that I have recently been in the castle , but how I got there and how I got out again , I have_ _n't the least idea .
First Lawyer .
Your honor has it on his own admission : he got drunk and in his drunkenness committed this unheard-of outrage .
All that remains is to decide whether the guilt of such a gross misdeed can be held devoid of criminal intent because=of intoxication .
I argue that it can_ _not , for if it could , neither fornication nor murder could be punished , for every criminal could seek that escape and assert that he had committed his crime while intoxicated .
And although he can prove that he was drunk , his case is none the stronger , for the law is : What a man does under the influence of drink he shall answer for when sober .
It is well=known that in a recent case of the same nature the misdeed was punished , although the criminal was led into passing himself off as a lord through his own simplicity ;
his ignorance and foolishness could not save him from death .
The penalty is imposed purely as a warning to others .
I would tell the circumstances , were it not that I fear to delay justice thereby .
Second Lawyer .
Your honor !
This story appears so remarkable to me that I can_ _not accept it without the testimony of several witnesses .
How could a simple peasant get into his lord's house and impersonate his lordship unless he could imitate his very form and features ?
How could he get into the lord's bedroom , how could he put on his clothes , without any one being aware of it ?
No , your honor , one can plainly see that this is the outcome of a conspiracy on the part of this poor man's enemies .
I hope , therefore , that he may be discharged .
Jeppe [ weeping ] .
God bless your mouth .
I have a=bit of tobacco in my breeches pocket which perhaps you will_ _n't refuse ;
it_ _s good enough for any honorable man to chew .
Second Lawyer .
Keep your tobacco , Jeppe !
I speak for you not in the hope of receiving gifts , but merely from Christian charity .
Jeppe .
Pardon me , Master Attorney !
I did_ _n't know you folks were so honorable .
First Lawyer .
What my colleague advances in favor of this man's acquittal is based entirely on conjecture .
The question is not whether such a thing could happen or not , because that it did happen is proved both by witnesses and by the man's own confession .
Second Lawyer .
What a man says from fear and awe has no weight as a confession .
It seems to me , therefore , that it is best to give the simple fellow time to collect his wits , then question him over again .
Judge .
Listen , Jeppe !
Be careful what you say .
Do you admit the charges against you ?
Jeppe .
No ;
I will swear my most sacred oath that it_ _s all lies that I swore to before ;
I have_ _n't been outside my door for the last three days .
First Lawyer .
Your honor , it is my humble opinion that he should not be allowed to testify on a matter already established by witnesses , particularly inasmuch=as he has already confessed his misdeed .
Second Lawyer .
I think he should .
First Lawyer .
I think he should not .
Second Lawyer .
The case is of so unusual a nature --
First Lawyer .
That does not affect witnesses and a confession .
Jeppe .
Oh , if they would only go for each other's throats , then I could set upon the judge and give him such a beating he would forget both law and procedure .
Second Lawyer .
But listen , worthy colleague !
Although the deed is confessed , the man has deserved no punishment , for he did no murder nor robbery nor harm of any kind while on the premises .
First Lawyer .
That makes no difference !
Intentio furandi is the same as furtum .
Jeppe .
Talk Danish , you black hound !
Then I can answer for myself .
First Lawyer .
For when a man is taken , whether he was about to steal or had already stolen , he is a thief .
Jeppe .
Gracious judge !
I am perfectly willing to be hanged if that attorney can be hanged alongside of me .
Second Lawyer .
Stop talking like that , Jeppe !
You are merely injuring your own case .
Jeppe .
Then why do_ _n't you answer him ? [ Aside .
] He stands like a dumb beast .
Second Lawyer .
But wherein is proof of furandi propositum ?
First Lawyer .
Quicunque ; in aedes alienas noctu irrumpit tanquam fur aut nocturnus grassator existimandus est ; atqui reus hic ita , ergo --
Second Lawyer .
Nego majorem , quod scilicet irruperit .
First Lawyer .
Res manifesta est , tot legitimis testibus existantibus , ac confitente reo .
Second Lawyer .
Quicunque ; vi vel metu coactus fuerit confiteri --
First Lawyer .
Oh , but where is the vis ?
Where is the metus ?
That is a quibble .
Second Lawyer .
You_ _re the one that quibbles .
First Lawyer .
No honorable man shall accuse me of that .
( They grab each=other by the throat , and Jeppe jumps behind them and pulls off the First=Lawyer's wig .
)
Judge .
Respect for the law !
Stop , I have heard enough . [ Reads aloud .
Jeppe .
Oh , oh , your honor !
Have you no mercy ?
Judge .
None is possible .
The sentence shall be carried out forthwith in the presence of the court .
Jeppe .
May I have a glass of brandy first , before I drink the poison , so I can die with courage ?
Judge .
That is permissible .
Jeppe [ drinks off three glasses of brandy , and falls on his knees ] . Will you not have mercy ?
Judge .
No , Jeppe ! It is now too late .
Jeppe .
Oh , it_ _s not too late .
A judge can reverse his decision and say he judged wrong the first-time .
We_ _re all merely men , so we_ _re all likely to make mistakes .
Judge .
No ; you yourself will feel in a=few minutes that it is too late , for you have already drunk the poison in the brandy .
Jeppe .
Alas , what an unfortunate man I am !
Have I taken the poison already ?
Oh , farewell , Nille !
But the beast does_ _n't deserve that I should take leave of her .
Farewell , Jens , Niels , and Christoffer !
Farewell , my daughter Marthe !
Farewell , apple of my eye !
I know I am your father because you were born before that deacon came around , and you take after me so we_ _re like as two drops of water .
Farewell , my piebald horse , and thank you for all the times I have ridden you ;
next=to my own children I never loved any animal as I love you .
Farewell , Feierfax , my good watchdog !
Farewell , Moens , my black cat !
Farewell , my oxen , my sheep , my pigs , and thank you for your good company and for every-day I have known you ! . . .
Farewell , . . .
Oh , now I can say no=more , I feel so heavy and so weak . [ He falls , and lies on the floor . ]
Judge .
That worked well ;
the sleeping-potion has already taken effect , and he is sleeping like a log .
Hang him up now , but be careful not to hurt him , and see that the rope goes only under his arms .
Then we shall see what he does when he wakes up and finds himself hanging .
[ They drag him out .
Act V
Scene 1
( Jeppe is discovered hanging from a gallows .
The Judge stands aside , unseen by Nille .
)
Nille .
Oh , oh , can it be that I see my good husband hanging on the gallows ?
Oh , my dearest husband !
Forgive me all the wrong I have done you .
Oh , now my conscience is roused ;
now I repent , but too late , for the ill nature I showed you ;
now that I miss you , for the first-time I can realize what a good husband I have lost .
Oh , that I could only save you from death with my own life's blood .
[ She wipes her eyes , and weeps bitterly .
Meanwhile the effects of the sleeping-potion have worn off , and Jeppe wakes .
He sees that be is hanging on the gallows , and that his hands are tied behind him , and he hears his wife's laments .
]
Jeppe .
Be calm , my dear wife , we must all go the same way .
Go home and look after the house and take good care of my children .
You can have my red jacket made over for little Christoffer , and what's left will do for a cap for Marthe .
Above=all , see to it that my piebald horse is well cared for , for I loved that beast as=if he had been my own brother .
If I were_ _n't dead , I_ _d have more to say to you .
Nille .
O -- o -- o -- !
What is that ?
What do I hear ?
Can a dead man talk ?
Jeppe .
Do_ _n't be afraid , Nille , I shall_ _n't hurt you .
Nille .
But , my dearest husband , how can you talk when you_ _re dead ?
Jeppe .
I do_ _n't know myself how it happens .
But listen , my dear wife !
Run like wildfire and bring me eightpence worth of brandy , for I am thirstier now than I ever was when I was alive .
Nille .
Shame , you beast !
You scoundrel !
You hopeless drunkard !
Have_ _n't you drunk enough brandy in your living lifetime ?
Are you still thirsty , you sot , now that you are dead ?
I call that being a full-blown hog .
Jeppe .
Shut your mouth , you scum of the earth !
and run for the brandy .
If you do_ _n't , devil take me if I do_ _n't haunt you in the house every night .
You shall soon find out that I am not afraid of Master Eric any=more , for now I can_ _n't feel a beating .
[ Nille runs home after Master Eric , comes out again , and beats him as be hangs .
]
Jeppe .
Ow , ow , ow !
Stop it , Nille , stop !
You_ _ll kill me all-over again . Ow ! ow ! ow !
The Judge [ coming forward ] .
Listen , my good woman !
You must not beat him any=more .
Be reassured ;
for your sake we will pardon your husband's transgression , and furthermore sentence him back to life again .
Nille .
No , no , good sir !
Let him hang , for he_ _s not worth letting live .
Judge .
Fie , you are a wicked woman ;
away with you , or we shall have you hanged alongside of him .
[ Nille runs away .
Scene 2
( Enter the Judge's servants , who take Jeppe down from the gallows .
)
Jeppe .
Oh , kind judge , am I surely all alive again , or am I spooking ?
Judge .
You are quite alive , for the law that can take away a man's life can also give it back again .
Can you not comprehend that ?
Jeppe .
No , indeed , I can_ _n't get it through my head , but I keep on thinking I_ _m a ghost , and am spooking .
Judge .
Foolish fellow !
It_ _s perfectly easy to understand .
He who takes a thing away from you can give it back again .
Jeppe .
Then may I try it and hang the judge just for fun to see if I can sentence him back to life again ?
Judge .
No , that will_ _n't work , because you_ _re not a judge .
Jeppe .
But am I really alive again ?
Judge .
Yes , you are .
Jeppe .
Then I_ _m not just a spook ?
Judge .
Certainly not .
Jeppe .
I_ _m not a ghost at=all ?
Judge .
No.
Jeppe .
Am I the same Jeppe of the Hill as I was before ?
Judge .
Yes .
Jeppe .
I_ _m no mere spirit ?
Judge .
No , certainly not .
Jeppe .
Will you give me your oath that_ _s true ?
Judge .
Yes , I swear to it ; you_ _re alive .
Jeppe .
Swear that the devil may split you if it_ _s not so .
Judge .
Come , take our word for it , and thank us for so graciously sentencing you back to life again .
Jeppe .
If you had_ _n't hanged me yourselves , I would gladly thank you for taking me down from the gallows .
Judge .
Be satisfied , Jeppe ! Tell us if your good wife beats you too often , and we shall find a remedy .
Here are four rix-dollars with which you can make merry for a while , and do_ _n't forget to drink our health .
[ Jeppe kisses his hand and thanks him .
]
[ Exit Judge , followed by his servants . Scene 3
Jeppe .
Now I_ _ve lived half a hundred years , but in all that time I have_ _n't had so much happen to me as=in these two days .
It is a devil of a story , now that I come to think of it : one-hour a drunken peasant , the next a baron , then another hour a peasant again ; now dead , now alive on a gallows , which is the most wonderful of all .
Perhaps it is that when they hang living people they die , and when they hang dead people they come to life again .
It seems to me that , after all , a glass of brandy would taste magnificent .
Hey , Jacob Shoemaker !
Come out here !
Scene 4 [ Enter Jacob=Shoemaker . ] Jacob .
Welcome back from town !
Did you get the soap for your wife ?
Jeppe .
You scoundrel !
You shall soon find out what sort of people you_ _re talking to .
Take off your cap , for you_ _re no=more than carrion compared to the likes of me .
Jacob .
I would_ _n't stand such words from any one else , Jeppe , but as you bring the house a good penny a day , I do_ _n't mind it so much .
Jeppe .
Take off your cap , I say , you cobbler !
Jacob .
What's happened to you on the way to make you so lofty ?
Jeppe .
I would have you know that I_ _ve been hanged since I saw you last .
Jacob .
There's nothing so splendid about that .
I do_ _n't grudge you your luck .
But listen , Jeppe : where you drink your liquor , there you pour out the dregs ;
you have gone and got full somewhere else , and now you come here to do your brawling .
Jeppe .
Quick , take off your cap , scoundrel !
Jacob ( his cap under his arm ) .
Heavens , man , where did you get the money ?
Jeppe .
From my barony , Jacob .
I will tell you all that_ _s happened to me ;
but get me a glass of mead , for I_ _m much too high and mighty to drink Danish brandy .
Jacob .
Your health , Jeppe !
Jeppe .
Now I shall tell you all that_ _s happened to me : When I left you , I fell asleep .
When I woke up , I was a baron , and got drunk all over again on pork-wine .
I woke up on a dungheap and went to sleep again , hoping to sleep myself back to my baron's estate .
I found it does_ _n't always work , for my wife woke me up again with Master Eric and pulled me home by the hair , not showing the least respect for the kind of man I had been .
When I got back to my room , I was thrown out again by the neck , and found myself in the midst of a=lot=of constables , who sentenced me to death and killed me with poison .
When I was dead , I was hanged ;
and when I was hanged , I came to life again ;
and when I came to life again , I got four rix-dollars .
That is my story , but as=to how it happened , I leave that to you to think out .
Jacob .
Ha , ha , ha !
It_ _s all a dream , Jeppe !
Jeppe .
If it were_ _n't for my four rix-dollars here , I might think it was a dream , too .
Give me another , Jacob !
I shall_ _n't think about all that rubbish any=more , but get myself decently drunk .
Jacob .
Your health , my lord baron !
Ha , ha , ha !
Jeppe .
Perhaps you can_ _n't grasp it , Jacob ?
Jacob .
No , not if I stood on my head .
Jeppe .
It can be true for=all=that , Jacob !
For you_ _re a dunce , and there are simpler things than this that you can_ _n't understand .
Scene 5
[ Enter Magnus .
]
Magnus .
Ha , ha , ha !
I nearly laughed myself to death when I heard the story from the bailiff's men .
By the Lord , I_ _d give a rix-dollar to see the fool !
Ha , ha , ha !
Jeppe .
What do I owe , Jacob ?
Jacob .
Twelvepence .
Magnus .
Why is that fellow in such a hurry ?
Jacob .
It_ _s the very man they played the joke on .
Mgnus .
Is that possible ?
I must run after him .
Listen , Jeppe !
Just a word -- How are things in the other world ?
Jeppe .
Let me be .
Magnus .
Why did_ _n't you stay longer ?
Jeppe .
What business is that of yours ?
Magnus .
Come , do tell us a little about the journey .
Jeppe .
Let me be , I say , or there_ _ll be a calamity coming to you .
Magnus .
But , Jeppe , I am so anxious to know about it .
Jeppe .
Jacob=Shoemaker , help !
Will you let this man do me violence in your house ?
Magnus .
I_ _m not doing you any harm , Jeppe , I_ _m just asking you what you saw in the other world .
Jeppe .
Hey , help , help !
Magnus .
Did you see any of my forefathers there ?
Jeppe .
No , your forefathers must all be in the other place , where you and all the rest of the carrion go when they die .
[ Shakes himself loose and runs away .
Scene 6 , Epilogue
( Enter the Baron , his Secretary , Valet , and Lackeys .
)
Baron .
Ha , ha , ha !
That experiment was worth money .
I never thought it would work=out so well .
If you could amuse me like that more often , Eric , you would stand even better with me than you do now .
Eric .
No , my lord !
I should not dare to play that kind of comedy again .
For if he had beaten your lordship as he threatened , it would have turned into an ugly tragedy .
Baron .
That's very true .
I was afraid of that , but I was so much engrossed in keeping up the deception that I really think I should have let myself be pummelled , or even let you be hanged , Eric , as he threatened , rather=than give it away .
Did_ _n't you feel the same ?
Eric .
No , indeed , my lord !
It would be an odd sensation , to let yourself be hanged for fun ;
that sort of fun would be too expensive .
Baron .
Why , Eric , such things happen every-day : people throw-away their lives for fun in one way or another .
For=instance , a man has a weak nature and sees that he is ruining his life and his health by excessive drinking ;
yet he still keeps on maltreating his body and risks his life for an evening's enjoyment .
Then , again : it often happens in Turkey that grand viziers are strangled or choked to death with a cord the very day they are made viziers , or a=few days after ;
yet every one is eager to take the office , just=so that he may be hanged with a great title .
Still another instance : officers gladly risk body and soul to get a reputation for bravery , and fight duels about anything at=all even with men known to be their superiors .
I think , too , that one could find hundreds and hundreds of men in=love who for=the=sake=of a night of pleasure would let themselves be killed in the morning .
And you see in sieges how soldiers will desert in droves and flock to the beleaguered city , which they know must shortly surrender , and in=order=to live in luxury for one-day will get themselves hanged the next .
One way is no=more rational than the other .
In olden times even philosophers used to subject themselves deliberately to misfortune in=order=that after their death they might be praised .
Therefore , Eric , I thoroughly believe that you would rather have allowed yourself to be hanged than have spoiled our beautiful practical joke .
( Spoken by the Baron )
Of this adventure , children , the moral is quite clear : To elevate the lowly above their proper sphere Involves no less a peril than rashly tumbling down The great who rise to power by deeds of just renown .
Permit the base-born yokel untutored sway to urge , The sceptre of dominion as soon becomes a scourge .
Let once despotic power drive justice from the realm , In every peaceful hamlet a Nero grasps the helm .
Could Phalaris or Caius in days of yore have been More merciless a tyrant than him we here have seen ?
Before the seat of justice had time his warmth to feel He threatened us with torture , the gallows , and the wheel .
Nay , never shall we tremble beneath a boor's dictates Or set a plowman over us , as oft in ancient states -- For if we sought to pattern us on follies such=as those , Each history of dominion in tyranny would close .
