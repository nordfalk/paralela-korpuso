The scene of the action is Tesman's villa , in the west end of Christiania .
Act First .
A spacious , handsome , and tastefully furnished drawing room , decorated in dark colours .
In the back , a wide doorway with curtains drawn back , leading into a smaller room decorated in the same style as the drawing-room .
In the right-hand wall of the front room , a folding door leading out to the hall .
In the opposite wall , on the left , a glass door , also with curtains drawn back .
Through the panes can be seen part of a verandah outside , and trees covered with autumn foliage .
An oval table , with a cover on it , and surrounded by chairs , stands well forward .
In=front , by the wall on the right , a wide stove of dark porcelain , a high-backed arm-chair , a cushioned foot-rest , and two footstools .
A settee , with a small round table in=front of it , fills the upper right-hand corner .
In=front , on the left , a little way from the wall , a sofa .
Further back than the glass door , a piano .
On either side of the doorway at the back a whatnot with terra-cotta and majolica ornaments .
-- Against the back wall of the inner room a sofa , with a table , and one or two chairs .
Over the sofa hangs the portrait of a handsome elderly man in a General's uniform .
Over the table a hanging lamp , with an opal glass shade .
-- A number of bouquets are arranged about the drawing-room , in vases and glasses .
Others lie upon the tables .
The floors in both rooms are covered with thick carpets .
-- Morning light .
MISS=JULIANA=TESMAN , with her bonnet on a carrying a parasol , comes in from the hall , followed by Berta , who carries a bouquet wrapped in paper .
Miss=tesman is a comely and pleasant- looking lady of about sixty-five .
She is nicely but simply dressed in a grey walking-costume .
Berta is a middle-aged woman of plain and rather countrified appearance .
Miss=tesman .
[ Also softly . ] I told you so , Miss .
Remember how late the steamboat got in last night .
And then , when they got home !
-- good Lord , what a=lot the young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed .
Miss=tesman . Well well -- let them have their sleep out .
But let us see that they get a good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear .
[ She goes to the glass door and throws it open . Berta .
[ Beside the table , at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand . ] I declare there is_ _n't a=bit of room left .
I think I_ _ll put it down here , Miss . [ She places it on the piano .
Miss=tesman .
So you_ _ve got a new mistress now , my dear Berta .
Heaven knows it was a wrench to me to part with you .
Berta . [ On the point of weeping .
] And do you think it was_ _n't hard for me , too , Miss ?
After all the blessed years I_ _ve been with you and Miss=Rina . ( 1 )
Miss=tesman . We must make the best of it , Berta .
There was nothing=else to be done .
George can_ _n't do without you , you see-he absolutely can_ _n't .
He has had you to look after him ever=since he was a little boy .
Berta . Ah but , Miss=Julia , I can_ _n't help thinking of Miss=Rina lying helpless at home there , poor thing .
And with only that new girl too !
She_ _ll never learn to take proper care of an invalid .
Miss=tesman . Oh , I shall manage to train her .
And of=course , you know , I shall take most of it upon myself .
You needn't be uneasy about my poor sister , my dear Berta . Berta .
Well , but there_ _s another thing , Miss .
I_ _m so mortally afraid I shall_ _n't be able to suit the young mistress .
Miss=tesman . Oh well -- just at=first there may be one or two things -- Berta .
Most like she_ _ll be terrible grand in her ways .
Miss=tesman .
Well , you can_ _n't wonder at that -- General Gabler's daughter !
Think of the sort of life she was accustomed to in her father's time .
Do_ _n't you remember how we used to see her riding down the road along=with the General ?
In that long black habit -- and with feathers in her hat ? Berta .
Yes , indeed -- I remember well enough !
-- But , good Lord , I should never have dreamt in those days that she and Master George would make a match of it .
Miss=tesman . Nor I .
-- But by-the-bye , Berta -- while I think of it : in future you must_ _n't say Master George .
You must say Dr.=Tesman .
Berta . Yes , the young mistress spoke of that too -- last night -- the moment they set foot in the house .
Is it true then , Miss ?
Miss=tesman . Yes , indeed it is .
Only think , Berta -- some foreign university has made him a doctor -- while he has been abroad , you understand .
Well well , he_ _s clever enough for anything , he is .
But I did_ _n't think he_ _d have gone in for doctoring people . Miss=tesman .
No no , it_ _s not that sort of doctor he is . [ Nods significantly .
You do_ _n't day so !
What can that be , Miss ?
Miss=tesman . [ Smiling . ] H'm -- would_ _n't you like to know ! [ With emotion .
] Ah , dear dear -- if my poor brother could only look up from his grave now , and see what his little boy has grown into ! [ Looks around .
] But bless me , Berta -- why have you done this ?
Taken the chintz covers off all the furniture .
Berta . The mistress told me to .
She can_ _n't abide covers on the chairs , she says .
Miss=tesman . Are they going to make this their everyday sitting-room then ? Berta .
Yes , that_ _s what I understood -- from the mistress .
Master George -- the doctor -- he said nothing .
George=tesman comes from the right into the inner room , humming to himself , and carrying an unstrapped empty portmanteau .
He is a middle-sized , young-looking man of thirty-three , rather stout , with a round , open , cheerful face , fair hair and beard .
He wears spectacles , and is somewhat carelessly dressed in comfortable indoor clothes .
Miss=tesman .
Good morning , good morning , George . Tesman .
[ In the doorway between the rooms .
] Aunt=Julia !
Dear=Aunt=Julia ! [ Goes up=to her and shakes hands warmly . ] Come all this way -- so early !
Eh ?
Miss=tesman . Why , of=course I had to come and see how you were getting on .
Tesman . In=spite=of your having had no proper night's rest ?
Miss=tesman . Oh , that makes no difference to me . Tesman .
Well , I suppose you got home all=right from the pier ?
Eh ?
Miss=tesman . Yes , quite safely , thank goodness .
Judge Brack was good enough to see me right to my door .
Tesman . We were so sorry we could_ _n't give you a seat in the carriage .
But you saw what a pile of boxes Hedda had to bring with her .
Miss=tesman . Yes , she had certainly plenty=of boxes .
Berta . [ To Tesman . ] Shall=I go in and see if there_ _s anything I can do for the mistress ?
Tesman . No thank you , Berta -- you needn't .
She said she would ring if she wanted anything . Berta .
[ Going towards the right . ] Very well . Tesman .
But look here -- take this portmanteau with you .
Berta . [ Taking it . ] I_ _ll put it in the attic .
[ She goes out by the hall door .
Tesman .
Fancy , Auntie -- I had the whole of that portmanteau chock full of copies of the documents .
You would_ _n't believe how much I have picked up from all the archives I have been examining -- curious old details that no=one has had any idea of --
Miss=tesman . Yes , you do_ _n't seem to have wasted you time on your wedding trip , George .
Tesman . No , that I have_ _n't .
But do take off your bonnet , Auntie .
Look here !
Let me untie the strings -- eh ?
Miss=tesman .
[ While he does so . ] Well well -- this is just as=if you were still at-home with us .
Tesman . [ With the bonnet in his hand , looks at it from all sides . ] Why , what a gorgeous bonnet you_ _ve been investing in !
Miss=tesman . I bought it on Hedda's account . Tesman .
On Hedda's account ?
Eh ?
Miss=tesman . Yes , so=that Hedda needn't be ashamed of me if we happened to go out together .
Tesman . [ Patting her cheek .
] You always think of everything , Aunt=Julia . [ Lays the bonnet on a chair beside the table .
] And now , look here -- suppose we sit comfortably on the sofa and have a little chat , till Hedda comes .
[ They seat themselves .
She places her parasol in the corner of the sofa .
Miss=tesman .
[ Takes both his hands and looks at him . ] What a delight it is to have you again , as large as life , before my very eyes , George !
My=George -- my poor brother's own boy !
Tesman .
And it_ _s a delight for me , too , to see you again , Aunt=Julia !
You , who have been father and mother in one to me .
Miss=tesman . Oh yes , I know you will always keep a place in your heart for your old aunts .
Tesman . And what about Aunt=Rina ? No improvement -- eh ?
Miss=tesman .
Oh , no -- we can scarcely look for any improvement in her case , poor thing .
There she lies , helpless , as she has lain for all these years .
But heaven grant I may not lose her yet awhile !
For if I did , I do_ _n't know what I should make of my life , George -- especially now that I have_ _n't you to look after any=more .
Tesman . [ Patting her back . ] There there there -- !
Miss=tesman . [ Suddenly changing her tone .
] And to think that here are you a married man , George !
-- And that you should be the one to carry off Hedda=Gabler -- the beautiful Hedda=Gabler !
Only think of it -- she , that was so beset with admirers !
Tesman .
[ Hums a little and smiles complacently .
] Yes , I fancy I have several good friends about town who would like to stand in my shoes -- eh ?
Miss=tesman .
And then this fine long wedding-tour you have had !
More=than five -- nearly six months -- Tesman .
Well , for me it has been a sort of tour of research as=well .
I have had to do so much grubbing among old records -- and to read no end of books too , Auntie . Miss=tesman .
Oh yes , I suppose so . [ More confidentially , and lowering her voice a little .
As=to our journey ?
Miss=tesman . Yes . Tesman .
No , I do_ _n't know of anything except what I have told you in my letters .
I had a doctor's degree conferred on me -- but that I told you yesterday .
Miss=tesman . Yes , yes , you did .
Expectations ?
Miss=tesman . Why you know , George -- I_ _m your old auntie ! Tesman .
Why , of=course I have expectations .
Miss=tesman . Ah !
Tesman . I have every expectation of being a professor one of these days .
Miss=tesman . Oh yes , a professor --
Tesman . Indeed , I may say I am certain of it .
But my dear Auntie -- you know-all about that already !
Miss=tesman . [ Laughing to herself . ] Yes , of=course I do .
You are quite right there . [ Changing the subject .
] But we were talking about your journey .
It must have cost a great deal of money , George ?
Tesman . Well , you see -- my handsome travelling-scholarship went a good way .
Miss=tesman . But I can_ _n't understand how you can have made it go far enough for two . Tesman .
No , that_ _s not easy to understand -- eh ?
Miss=tesman .
And especially travelling with a lady -- they tell me that makes it ever so much=more expensive .
Tesman .
Yes , of=course -- it makes it a=little more expensive .
But Hedda had to have this trip , Auntie !
She really had to .
Nothing=else would have done . Miss=tesman .
No no , I suppose not .
A wedding-tour seems to be quite indispensable nowadays .
-- But tell me now -- have you gone thoroughly over the house yet ? Tesman .
Yes , you may be sure I have .
I have been afoot ever=since daylight .
Miss=tesman . And what do you think of it all ? Tesman .
I_ _m delighted !
Quite delighted !
Why of=course you are quite right , Aunt=Julia !
You mean as my library increases -- eh ?
Miss=tesman .
Yes , quite so , my dear boy .
It was your library I was thinking of .
Tesman . I am specially pleased on Hedda's account .
Yes , it was lucky that this very house should come into the market , just after you had started .
Tesman .
Yes , Aunt=Julia , the luck was on our side , was_ _n't it -- eh ?
Miss=tesman .
But the expense , my dear George !
You will find it very expensive , all this .
Tesman . [ Looks at her , a little cast down .
] Yes , I suppose I shall , Aunt !
Miss=tesman . Oh , frightfully !
Tesman . How much do you think ? In round numbers ?
-- Eh ?
Miss=tesman . Oh , I can_ _n't even guess until all the accounts come in . Tesman .
Well , fortunately , Judge Brack has secured the most favourable terms for me , so he said in a letter to Hedda .
Miss=tesman .
Yes , do_ _n't be uneasy , my dear boy .
-- Besides , I have given security for the furniture and all the carpets .
Tesman . Security ?
You ?
My dear Aunt=Julia -- what sort of security could you give ?
Miss=tesman . I have given a mortgage on our annuity .
Tesman . [ Jumps up .
] What ! On your -- and Aunt=Rina's annuity !
Miss=tesman . Yes , I knew of no other plan , you see .
Tesman . [ Placing himself before her .
] Have you gone out=of your senses , Auntie ?
Your annuity -- it_ _s all that you and Aunt=Rina have to live upon .
Miss=tesman . Well well -- do_ _n't get so excited about it .
It_ _s only a matter of form you know -- Judge Brack assured me of that .
It was he that was kind enough to arrange the whole affair for me .
A mere matter of form , he said .
Tesman . Yes , that may be all very well .
But nevertheless --
Miss=tesman . You will have your own salary to depend upon now .
And , good=heavens , even=if we did have to pay up a little -- !
To eke things out a=bit at the start -- !
Why , it would be nothing but a pleasure to us .
Tesman . Oh Auntie -- will you never be tired of making sacrifices for me !
Miss=tesman . [ Rises and lays her hand on his shoulders . ] Have=I any other happiness in this world except to smooth your way for you , my dear boy .
You , who have had neither father nor mother to depend on .
And now we have reached the goal , George !
Things have looked black enough for us , sometimes ;
but , thank heaven , now you have nothing to fear .
Tesman . Yes , it is really marvellous how every thing has turned out for the best .
Miss=tesman . And the people who opposed you -- who wanted to bar the way for you -- now you have them at your feet .
They have fallen , George .
Your most dangerous rival -- his fall was the worst .
Have you heard anything of Eilert ?
Since I went away , I mean .
Miss=tesman . Only that he is said to have published a new book .
Tesman . What !
Eilert=Lovborg !
Recently -- eh ?
Miss=tesman .
Yes , so they say .
Heaven knows whether it can be worth anything !
Ah , when your new book appears -- that will be another story , George !
What is it to be about ?
Tesman . It will deal with the domestic industries of Brabant during the Middle Ages .
Miss=tesman . Fancy -- to be able to write on such a subject as that !
Tesman . However , it may be some time before the book is ready .
I have all these collections to arrange first , you see . Miss=tesman .
Yes , collecting and arranging -- no=one can beat you at that .
There you are my poor brother's own son . Tesman .
I am looking forward eagerly to setting to work at it ;
especially now that I have my own delightful home to work in .
[ Embracing her . ] Oh yes , yes , Aunt=Julia !
Hedda -- she is the best part of it all !
I believe I hear her coming -- eh ?
Hedda enters from the left through the inner room .
Her face and figure show refinement and distinction .
Her complexion is pale and opaque .
Her steel-grey eyes express a cold , unruffled repose .
Her hair is of an agreeable brown , but not particularly abundant .
She is dressed in a tasteful , somewhat loose-fitting morning gown .
Miss=tesman .
[ Going to meet Hedda . ] Good morning , my dear Hedda !
Good morning , and a hearty welcome !
Hedda . [ Holds out her hand . ] Good morning , dear Miss=Tesman !
So early a call !
That is kind of you .
Oh yes , thanks .
Passably .
Tesman . [ Laughing .
] Passably ! Come , that_ _s good , Hedda !
You were sleeping like a stone when I got up . Hedda .
Fortunately .
] Oh , there the servant has gone and opened the veranda door , and let in a whole flood of sunshine .
Miss=tesman .
[ Going towards the door . ] Well , then we will shut it .
Hedda . No no , not that !
Tesman , please draw the curtains .
That will give a softer light .
Tesman . [ At the door .
] All=right -- all=right .
-- There now , Hedda , now you have both shade and fresh air .
Hedda . Yes , fresh air we certainly must have , with all these stacks of flowers -- .
But -- will_ _n't you sit down , Miss=Tesman ?
Miss=tesman . No , thank you .
Now that I have seen that everything is all=right here -- thank heaven !
-- I must be getting home again .
My sister is lying longing for me , poor thing .
Tesman . Give her my very best love , Auntie ;
and say I shall look in and see her later in the day . Miss=tesman .
Yes , yes , I_ _ll be sure to tell her .
But by-the-bye , George -- [ Feeling in her dress pocket ] -- I had almost forgotten -- I have something for you here .
Tesman .
What is it , Auntie ?
Eh ?
Miss=tesman . [ Produces a flat parcel wrapped in newspaper and hands it to him . ] Look here , my dear boy . Tesman . [ Opening the parcel .
] Well , I declare ! -- Have you really saved them for me , Aunt=Julia !
Hedda !
is_ _n't this touching -- eh ?
Hedda .
[ Beside the whatnot on the right .
] Well , what is it ? Tesman .
My old morning-shoes !
My slippers .
Hedda . Indeed . I remember you often spoke of them while we were abroad . Tesman .
Yes , I missed them terribly . [ Goes up=to her .
] Now you shall see them , Hedda ! Hedda .
[ Going towards the stove . ] Thanks , I really do_ _n't care about it .
Tesman . [ Following her .
] Only think -- ill as she was , Aunt=Rina embroidered these for me .
Oh you can_ _n't think how many associations cling to them .
Hedda . [ At the table . ] Scarcely for me .
Miss=tesman . Of=course not for Hedda , George .
Tesman . Well , but now that she belongs to the family , I thought --
Hedda . [ Interrupting . ] We shall never get on with this servant , Tesman .
Miss=tesman . Not get on with Berta ? Tesman .
Why , dear , what puts that in your head ?
Eh ?
Hedda . [ Pointing . ] Look there !
She has left her old bonnet lying about on a chair .
Tesman . [ In consternation , drops the slippers on the floor . ] Why , Hedda -- Hedda .
Just fancy , if any one should come in and see it !
Tesman . But Hedda -- that_ _s Aunt=Julia's bonnet . Hedda .
Is it !
Miss=tesman . [ Taking up the bonnet . ] Yes , indeed it_ _s mine .
And , what's more , it_ _s not old , Madam Hedda . Hedda .
I really did not look closely at it , Miss=Tesman .
Miss=tesman . [ Trying on the bonnet .
] Let me tell you it_ _s the first-time I have worn it -- the very first-time . Tesman .
And a very nice bonnet it is too -- quite a beauty !
Miss=tesman .
Oh , it_ _s no=such great things , George . [ Looks around her .
] My parasol -- ?
Ah , here . [ Takes it .
] For this is mine too -- [ mutters ] -- not Berta's .
Tesman .
A new bonnet and a new parasol !
Only think , Hedda .
Hedda . Very handsome indeed . Tesman .
Yes , is_ _n't it ?
Eh ?
But=Auntie , take a good look at Hedda before you go !
See how handsome she is !
Miss=tesman . Oh , my dear boy , there_ _s nothing new in that .
Hedda was always lovely . [ She nods and goes toward the right .
Tesman . [ Following .
] Yes , but have you noticed what splendid condition she is in ?
How she has filled out on the journey ?
Hedda . [ Crossing the room . ] Oh , do be quiet -- !
Miss=tesman . [ Who has stopped and turned . ] Filled out ?
Tesman . Of=course you do_ _n't notice it so much now that she has that dress on .
But I , who can see -- Hedda .
[ At the glass door , impatiently . ] Oh , you can_ _n't see anything .
Tesman . It must be the mountain air in the Tyrol --
Hedda . [ Curtly , interrupting . ] I am exactly as I was when I started .
Tesman . So you insist ;
but I_ _m quite certain you are not .
Do_ _n't you agree with me , Auntie ? Miss=tesman .
[ Who has been gazing at her with folded hands . ] Hedda is lovely -- lovely -- lovely . [ Goes up=to her , takes her head between both hands , draws it downwards , and kisses her hair .
] God bless and preserve Hedda Tesman -- for George's sake .
Hedda .
[ Gently freeing herself . ] Oh -- !
Let me go .
Miss=tesman . [ In quiet emotion . ] I shall not let a day pass without coming to see you . Tesman .
No you will_ _n't , will you , Auntie ?
Eh ?
Miss=tesman . Good-bye -- good-bye !
[ She goes out by the hall door .
Tesman accompanies her .
The door remains half-open .
Tesman can be heard repeating his message to Aunt=Rina and his thanks for the slippers .
[ In the meantime , Hedda walks about the room , raising her arms and clenching her hands as=if in desperation .
Then she flings back the curtains from the glass door , and stands there looking out .
[ Presently , Tesman returns and closes the door behind him . Tesman .
[ Picks up the slippers from the floor . ] What are you looking at , Hedda ?
Hedda .
[ Once=more calm and mistress of herself .
] I am only looking at the leaves .
They are so yellow -- so withered .
Tesman .
[ Again restless . ] Yes , to think of it ! -- already in -- in September .
Tesman . Do_ _n't you think Aunt=Julia's manner was strange , dear ?
Almost solemn ?
Can you imagine what was the matter with her ?
Eh ?
Hedda . I scarcely know her , you see .
Is she not often like that ?
Tesman . No , not as she was to-day .
Oh , scarcely at=all .
Perhaps a little , just at the moment --
Hedda . But what an idea , to pitch her bonnet about in the drawing-room !
No=one does that sort of thing .
Tesman . Well you may be sure Aunt=Julia will_ _n't do it again . Hedda .
In any case , I shall manage to make my peace with her .
Tesman . Yes , my dear , good Hedda , if you only would .
Hedda . When you call this afternoon , you might invite her to spend the evening here .
Tesman . Yes , that I will .
And there_ _s one thing more you could do that would delight her heart . Hedda .
What is it ?
Tesman . If you could only prevail on yourself to say _du_ ( 3 ) to her .
For my sake , Hedda ?
Eh ?
Hedda . No , no , Tesman -- you really must_ _n't ask that of me .
I have told you so already .
I shall try to call her « Aunt » ;
and you must be satisfied with that . Tesman .
Well well .
Only I think now that you belong to the family , you -- Hedda .
H'm -- I can_ _n't in the least see why --
[ She goes up towards the middle doorway .
Tesman .
[ After a pause . ] Is there anything the matter with you , Hedda ?
Eh ?
Hedda . I_ _m only looking at my old piano .
It does_ _n't go at=all well with all the other things .
Tesman . The first-time I draw my salary , we_ _ll see about exchanging it .
Hedda . No , no -- no exchanging .
I do_ _n't want to part with it .
Suppose we put it there in the inner room , and then get another here in its place .
When it_ _s convenient , I mean . Tesman .
[ A little taken aback .
] Yes -- of=course we could do that . Hedda .
[ Takes up the bouquet from the piano . ] These flowers were not here last night when we arrived .
Tesman . Aunt Julia must have brought them for you .
Hedda . [ Examining the bouquet .
] A visiting-card . [ Takes it out and reads : ] « Shall return later in the day . »
Can you guess whose card it is ?
Tesman .
No. Whose ?
Eh ?
Hedda . The name is « Mrs.=Elvsted . »
Tesman .
Is it really ?
Sheriff Elvsted's wife ?
Miss=Rysing that was .
Hedda . Exactly . The girl with the irritating hair , that she was always showing off .
An old flame of yours I_ _ve been told .
Tesman . [ Laughing . ] Oh , that did_ _n't last long ;
and it was before I met you , Hedda .
But fancy her being in-town ! Hedda .
It_ _s odd that she should call upon us .
I have scarcely seen her since we left school .
Tesman . I have_ _n't see her either for -- heaven knows how long .
I wonder how she can endure to live in such an out-of-the way hole -- eh ?
Hedda .
Yes , he is somewhere in that part of the country .
Berta enters by the hall door . Berta .
That lady , ma'am , that brought some flowers a little while ago , is here again . [ Pointing .
] The flowers you have in your hand , ma'am .
Hedda . Ah , is she ?
Well , please show her in .
Berta opens the door for Mrs . Elvsted , and goes out herself .
-- Mrs . Elvsted is a woman of fragile figure , with pretty , soft features .
Her eyes are light blue , large , round , and somewhat prominent , with a startled , inquiring expression .
Her hair is remarkably light , almost flaxen , and unusually abundant and wavy .
She is a couple of years younger than Hedda .
She wears a dark visiting dress , tasteful , but not quite in the latest fashion .
Hedda .
[ Receives her warmly . ] How do you do , my dear Mrs.=Elvsted ?
It_ _s delightful to see you again . Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Nervously , struggling for self-control . ] Yes , it_ _s a very long-time since we met .
Tesman . [ Gives her his hand . ] And we too -- eh ?
Hedda .
Thanks for your lovely flowers -- Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh , not at=all -- .
I would have come straight here yesterday afternoon ;
but I heard that you were away -- Tesman .
Have you just come to town ?
Eh ?
Mrs . Elvsted . I arrived yesterday , about midday .
Oh , I was quite in despair when I heard that you were not at-home .
Hedda .
In despair !
How so ? Tesman . Why , my dear Mrs.=Rysing -- I mean Mrs.=Elvsted -- Hedda .
I hope that you are not in any trouble ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , I am .
And I do_ _n't know another living creature here that I can turn to .
Elvsted . Oh , I am too restless to sit down . Hedda .
Oh no , you_ _re not .
Come here .
[ She draws Mrs . Elvsted down upon the sofa and sits at her side .
Tesman .
Well ?
What is it , Mrs.=Elvsted -- ?
Hedda .
Has anything particular happened to you at-home ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes -- and no. Oh -- I am so anxious you should not misunderstand me --
Hedda . Then your best plan is to tell us the whole story , Mrs.=Elvsted . Tesman .
I suppose that_ _s what you have come for -- eh ?
Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , yes -- of=course it is .
Well then , I must tell you -- if you do_ _n't already know -- that Eilert=Lovborg is in-town , too .
Hedda . Lovborg -- !
Tesman . What !
Has=Eilert=Lovborg come back ?
Fancy that , Hedda !
Hedda . Well well -- I hear it . Mrs .
Elvsted . He has been here a week already .
Just fancy -- a whole week !
In this terrible town , alone !
With so many temptations on=all=sides . Hedda .
But , my dear Mrs.=Elvsted -- how does he concern you so much ?
Mrs . Elvsted . [ Looks at her with a startled air , and says rapidly .
] He was the children's tutor .
Hedda . Your children's ?
Mrs . Elvsted .
My husband's . I have none . Hedda . Your step-children's , then ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes .
Tesman . [ Somewhat hesitatingly . ] Then was he -- I do_ _n't know how to express it -- was he -- regular enough in his habits to be fit for the post ?
Eh ?
Mrs . Elvsted . For the last two years his conduct has been irreproachable . Tesman .
Has it indeed ?
Fancy that , Hedda !
Hedda . I hear it .
Mrs . Elvsted . Perfectly irreproachable , I assure you !
In every respect .
But all the same -- now that I know he is here -- in this great town -- and with a large sum of money in his hands -- I can_ _n't help being in mortal fear for him .
Tesman .
Why did he not remain where he was ?
With you and your husband ?
Eh ?
Mrs . Elvsted . After his book was published he was too restless and unsettled to remain with us .
Tesman . Yes , by-the-bye , Aunt=Julia told me he had published a new book . Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , a big book , dealing with the march of civilisation -- in broad outline , as it were .
It came out about a fortnight ago .
And since it has sold so well , and been so much read -- and made such a sensation --
Tesman . Has it indeed ?
It must be something he has had lying by since his better days . Mrs .
Elvsted . Long-ago , you mean ?
Tesman . Yes .
Mrs . Elvsted . No , he has written it all since he has been with us -- within the last year . Tesman .
Is_ _n't that good news , Hedda ?
Think of that .
Mrs .
Elvsted .
Ah yes , if only it would last !
Hedda . Have you seen him here in-town ? Mrs .
Elvsted . No , not=yet .
I have had the greatest difficulty in finding out his address .
But this morning I discovered it at=last .
Elvsted . [ Starting nervously .
] Of my husband !
What ? Hedda . That he should send you to town on such an errand -- that he does not come himself and look after his friend .
Mrs . Elvsted .
Oh no , no -- my husband has no time .
And besides , I -- I had some shopping to do . Hedda .
[ With a slight smile . ] Ah , that is a different matter . Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Rising quickly and uneasily . ] And now I beg and implore you , Mr. Tesman -- receive Eilert=Lovborg kindly if he comes to you !
And that he is sure to do .
You see you were such great friends in the old days .
And then you are interested in the same studies -- the same branch of science -- so=far as I can understand .
Tesman . We used to be at=any=rate .
Mrs . Elvsted .
That is why I beg so earnestly that you -- you too -- will keep a sharp eye upon him .
Oh , you will promise me that , Mr.=Tesman -- will_ _n't you ? Tesman .
With the greatest of pleasure , Mrs.=Rysing --
Hedda . Elvsted .
Tesman . I assure you I shall do all I possibly can for Eilert .
You may rely upon me . Mrs . Elvsted .
Oh , how very , very kind of you ! [ Presses his hands .
] Thanks , thanks , thanks ! [ Frightened .
] You see , my husband is so very fond of him ! Hedda . [ Rising .
] You ought=to write to him , Tesman .
Perhaps he may not care to come to you of his own accord .
Tesman . Well , perhaps it would be the right thing to do , Hedda ?
Eh ?
Hedda . And the sooner the better .
Why not at=once ?
Mrs . Elvsted . [ Imploringly . ] Oh , if you only would !
Tesman . I_ _ll write this moment .
Have you his address , Mrs.-- Mrs.=Elvsted .
Mrs . Elvsted .
Yes . [ Takes a slip of paper from her pocket , and hands it to him . ] Here it is .
Tesman . Good , good .
Then I_ _ll go in -- [ Looks about him .
] By-the-bye , -- my slippers ?
Oh , here . [ Takes the packet and is about to go .
Hedda . Be sure you write him a cordial , friendly letter .
And a good long one too .
Tesman . Yes , I will . Mrs .
Elvsted . But please , please do_ _n't say a word to show that I have suggested it .
Tesman . No , how could you think I would ?
Eh ?
[ He goes out to the right , through the inner room .
Hedda .
[ Goes up=to Mrs . Elvsted , smiles , and says in a low voice . ] There !
We have killed two birds with one stone .
Mrs . Elvsted .
What do you mean ? Hedda . Could you not see that I wanted him to go ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , to write the letter -- Hedda .
And that I might speak to you alone . Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Confused .
] About the same thing ?
Hedda . Precisely . Mrs .
Elvsted .
[ Apprehensively .
] But there is nothing more , Mrs.=Tesman !
Absolutely nothing !
Hedda . Oh yes , but there is . There is a great deal more -- I can see that .
Sit here -- and we_ _ll have a cosy , confidential chat . [ She forces Mrs . Elvsted to sit in the easy-chair beside the stove , and seats herself on one of the footstools .
Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Anxiously , looking at her watch .
] But , my dear Mrs.=Tesman -- I was really on the point of going . Hedda .
Oh , you can_ _n't be in such a hurry .
-- Well ?
Now tell me something about your life at-home . Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh , that is just what I care least to speak about .
Hedda . But to me , dear -- ?
Why , were_ _n't we schoolfellows ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , but you were in the class above me .
Oh , how dreadfully afraid of you I was then ! Hedda .
Afraid of me ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , dreadfully .
For when we met on the stairs you used always to pull my hair .
Hedda . Did I , really ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , and once you said you would burn it off my head .
Hedda . Oh that was all nonsense , of=course . Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , but I was so silly in those days .
-- And since=then , too -- we have drifted so=far -- far apart=from each=other .
Our circles have been so entirely different .
Hedda . Well then , we must try to drift together again .
Now listen .
At school we said _du_ ( 4 ) to each=other ; and we called each=other by our Christian names -- Mrs . Elvsted .
No , I am sure you must be mistaken .
Hedda . No , not at=all !
I can remember quite distinctly .
So now we are going to renew our old friendship . [ Draws the footstool closer to Mrs . Elvsted .
] There now ! [ Kisses her cheek . ] You must say _du_ to me and call me Hedda .
Mrs . Elvsted . [ Presses and pats her hands .
] Oh , how good and kind you are !
I am not used to such kindness . Hedda .
There , there , there !
And I shall say _du_ to you , as=in the old days , and call you my dear Thora . Mrs .
Elvsted . My name is Thea . ( 5 )
Hedda .
Why , of=course !
I meant Thea . [ Looks at her compassionately .
] So you are not accustomed to goodness and kindness , Thea ?
Not in your own home ?
Mrs . Elvsted . Oh , if I only had a home !
But I have_ _n't any ;
I have never had a home .
Hedda . [ Looks at her for a moment . ] I almost suspected as much . Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Gazing helplessly before her . ] Yes -- yes -- yes . Hedda .
I do_ _n't quite remember -- was it not as housekeeper that you first went to Mr.=Elvsted's ? Mrs .
Elvsted . I really went as governess .
But his wife -- his late wife -- was an invalid , -- and rarely left her room .
So I had to look after the housekeeping as=well . Hedda .
And then -- at=last -- you became mistress of the house . Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Sadly . ] Yes , I did . Hedda .
Let me see -- about how long=ago was that ?
Mrs . Elvsted .
My marriage ? Hedda .
Yes . Mrs .
Elvsted . Five years ago .
Hedda . To be sure ;
it must be that .
Mrs . Elvsted . Oh those five years -- !
Or at all events the last two or three of them !
Oh , if you ( 6 ) could only imagine -- Hedda .
[ Giving her a little slap on the hand . ] De ?
Fie , Thea !
Mrs . Elvsted . Yes , yes , I will try -- .
Well , if -- you could only imagine and understand --
[ Looks at here doubtfully . ] Eilert=Lovborg ?
Yes -- he has .
Hedda . Had you known him before , in town here ? Mrs . Elvsted .
Scarcely at=all .
I mean -- I knew him by name of=course .
Hedda . But you saw a good deal of him in the country ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , he came to us every-day .
You see , he gave the children lessons ;
for in the long-run I could_ _n't manage it all myself .
Hedda . No , that_ _s clear .
-- And your husband -- ?
I suppose he is often away from home ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes .
Well , then you must question me .
Hedda . What sort of a man is your husband , Thea ?
I mean -- you know -- in everyday life .
Is he kind to you ? Mrs .
I should think he must be altogether too old for you .
There is at=least twenty years' difference between you , is there not ? Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Irritably .
] Yes , that is true , too .
Everything about him is repellent to me !
We have not a thought in common .
We have no single point of sympathy -- he and I . Hedda .
But is he not fond of you all=the=same ?
In his own way ? Mrs . Elvsted .
Oh I really do_ _n't know .
I think he regards me simply as a useful property .
And then it does_ _n't cost much to keep me .
I am not expensive . Hedda .
That is stupid of you . Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Shakes her head .
] It can_ _not be otherwise -- not with him .
I do_ _n't think he really cares for any one but himself -- and perhaps a little for the children .
Hedda .
And for Eilert=Lovborg , Thea ?
Mrs . Elvsted . [ Looking at her .
] For=Eilert=Lovborg ?
What puts that into your head ? Hedda . Well , my dear -- I should say , when he sends you after him all the way to town -- [ Smiling almost imperceptibly . ] And besides , you said so yourself , to Tesman .
Mrs . Elvsted .
[ With a little nervous twitch .
] Did=I ?
Yes , I suppose I did . [ Vehemently , but not loudly . ] No -- I may just as=well make a clean breast of it at=once !
For it must all come out in any case .
Hedda . Why , my dear Thea -- ?
Mrs . Elvsted .
Well , to make a long story short : My husband did not know that I was coming .
Hedda .
What !
Your husband did_ _n't know it ! Mrs .
Elvsted . No , of=course not .
For that matter , he was away from home himself -- he was travelling .
Oh , I could bear it no=longer , Hedda !
I could_ _n't indeed -- so utterly alone as I should have been in future .
Hedda . Well ?
And then ?
Mrs . Elvsted . So I put=together some of my things -- what I needed most -- as quietly as possible .
And then I left the house .
Hedda .
Without a word ?
Mrs .
Elvsted .
Yes -- and took the train to town . Hedda .
Why , my dear , good Thea -- to think of you daring to do it ! Mrs .
But what do you think your husband will say when you go home again ? Mrs .
Elvsted . [ At the table , looks at her .
] Back to him ? Hedda .
Of=course . Mrs . Elvsted . I shall never go back to him again .
Elvsted . Yes .
There was nothing=else to be done . Hedda .
But then -- to take flight so openly . Mrs . Elvsted .
Oh , it_ _s impossible to keep things of that sort secret .
Hedda . But what do you think people will say of you , Thea ? Mrs .
Elvsted . They may say what they like , for aught _I_ care . [ Seats herself wearily and sadly on the sofa .
[ After a short silence . ] And what are your plans now ?
What do you think of doing . Mrs .
Elvsted . I do_ _n't know yet .
I only know this , that I must live here , where Eilert Lovborg is -- if I am to live at=all .
Hedda .
Elvsted . Oh it grew up gradually .
I gained a sort of influence over him .
Hedda .
Indeed ? Mrs . Elvsted .
He gave up his old habits .
Not because I asked him to , for I never dared do that .
But of=course he saw how repulsive they were to me ;
and so he dropped them . Hedda .
Elvsted . So he says himself , at=any=rate .
And he , on his side , has made a real human being of me -- taught me to think , and to understand so many things .
Hedda . Did he give you lessons too , then ?
Mrs . Elvsted .
No , not exactly lessons .
But he talked to me -- talked about such an infinity of things .
And then came the lovely , happy time when I began to share in his work -- when he allowed me to help him !
Hedda . Oh he did , did he ?
Mrs . Elvsted .
Yes !
He never wrote anything without my assistance . Hedda .
You were two good comrades , in=fact ? Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Eagerly . ] Comrades !
Yes , fancy , Hedda -- that is the very word he used !
-- Oh , I ought=to feel perfectly happy ;
and yet I can_ _not ;
for I do_ _n't know how long it will last .
Hedda . Are you no surer of him than that ? Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Gloomily . ] A woman's shadow stands between Eilert=Lovborg and me .
Hedda . [ Looks at her anxiously . ] Who can that be ? Mrs .
Elvsted . I do_ _n't know .
Some one he knew in his -- in his past .
Some one he has never been able wholly to forget . Hedda .
What has he told you -- about this ? Mrs .
Elvsted . He has only once -- quite vaguely -- alluded to it .
Hedda .
Well ! And what did he say ?
Mrs . Elvsted . He said that when they parted , she threatened to shoot him with a pistol .
Hedda . [ With cold composure .
] Oh nonsense ! No=one does that sort of thing here . Mrs .
Elvsted .
No. And that is why I think it must have been that red-haired singing-woman whom he once --
Hedda . Yes , very likely .
Oh -- then of=course it must have been she . Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Wringing her hands . ] And now just fancy , Hedda -- I hear that this singing-woman -- that she is in town again !
Oh , I do_ _n't know what to do --
Hedda . [ Glancing towards the inner room . ] Hush !
Here comes Tesman . [ Rises and whispers .
] Thea -- all this must remain between you and me . Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Springing up . ] Oh yes -- yes !
For heaven's sake -- !
George=tesman , with a letter in his hand , comes from the right through the inner room .
Tesman .
There now -- the epistle is finished .
Hedda . That's right .
And now Mrs.=Elvsted is just going .
Wait a moment -- I_ _ll go with you to the garden gate . Tesman .
Do you think Berta could post the letter , Hedda dear ? Hedda .
[ Takes it . ] I will tell her to .
Berta enters from the hall .
Berta .
Judge Brack wishes to know if Mrs.=Tesman will receive him .
Hedda . Yes , ask Judge Brack to come in .
And look here -- put this letter in the post .
Berta . [ Taking the letter . ] Yes , ma'am .
[ She opens the door for Judge Brack and goes out herself .
Brack is a main of forty-five ;
thick-set , but well-built and elastic in his movements .
His face is roundish with an aristocratic profile .
His hair is short , still almost black , and carefully dressed .
His eyebrows thick .
His moustaches are also thick , with short-cut ends .
He wears a well-cut walking-suit , a little too youthful for his age .
He uses an eye-glass , which he now=and=then lets drop .
Judge Brack .
[ With his hat in his hand , bowing .
] May one venture to call so early in the day ?
Hedda . Of=course one may .
Tesman . [ Presses his hand .
] You are welcome at any time . [ Introducing him . ] Judge Brack -- Miss=Rysing --
Hedda . Oh -- !
Brack . [ Bowing . ] Ah -- delighted -- Hedda .
[ Looks at him and laughs . ] It_ _s nice to have a look at you by daylight , Judge !
Brack . So you find me -- altered ?
Hedda . A=little younger , I think .
Brack . Thank you so much .
Tesman . But what do you think of Hedda -- eh ?
Does_ _n't she look flourishing ?
She has actually --
Hedda . Oh , do leave me alone .
You have_ _n't thanked Judge Brack for all the trouble he has taken --
Brack . Oh , nonsense -- it was a pleasure to me --
Hedda . Yes , you are a friend indeed .
But here stands Thea all impatience to be off -- so _au revoir_ Judge .
I shall be back again presently .
[ Mutual salutations .
Mrs . Elvsted and Hedda go out by the hall door .
Brack .
Well , -- is your wife tolerably satisfied -- Tesman .
Yes , we can_ _n't thank you sufficiently .
Of=course she talks of a little re-arrangement here=and=there ;
and one or two things are still wanting .
We shall have to buy some additional trifles . Brack .
Indeed !
Tesman .
But we will_ _n't trouble you about these things .
Hedda say she herself will look after what is wanting .
-- Shall_ _n't we sit down ?
Eh ?
Brack . Thanks , for a moment . [ Seats himself beside the table .
Indeed ?
Ah , I understand ! [ Seating himself .
] I suppose it_ _s the serious part of the frolic that is coming now .
Eh ?
Brack . Oh , the money question is not so very pressing ;
though , for that matter , I wish we had gone a=little more economically to work . Tesman .
But that would never have done , you know !
Think=of=Hedda , my dear fellow !
You , who know her so well -- !
I could_ _n't possibly ask her to put up with a shabby style of living ! Brack .
No , no -- that is just the difficulty .
Tesman . And then -- fortunately -- it can_ _n't be long=before I receive my appointment . Brack .
Well , you see -- such things are often apt to hang fire for a long-time .
Tesman . Have you heard anything definite ?
Eh ?
Brack . Nothing exactly definite -- . [ Interrupting himself .
Well ? Brack .
Your old friend , Eilert=Lovborg , has returned to town .
Tesman . I know that already .
Brack . Indeed !
How did you learn it ? Tesman .
From that lady who went out with Hedda . Brack .
Really ?
What was her name ?
I did_ _n't quite catch it .
Tesman . Mrs.=Elvsted .
Brack . Aha -- Sheriff Elvsted's wife ?
Of=course -- he has been living up in their regions .
Tesman . And fancy -- I_ _m delighted to hear that he is quite a reformed character .
Brack . So they say . Tesman .
And then he has published a new book -- eh ?
Brack .
Yes , indeed he has .
Tesman . And I hear it has made some sensation !
Brack . Quite an unusual sensation . Tesman .
Fancy -- is_ _n't that good news !
A man of such extraordinary talents -- .
I felt so grieved to think that he had gone irretrievably to ruin .
Brack . That was what everybody thought .
Tesman . But I can_ _not imagine what he will take to now !
How in the world will he be able to make his living ?
Eh ?
[ During the last words , Hedda has entered by the hall door .
Hedda .
Well you see , dear -- we were talking about poor Eilert=Lovborg .
Hedda . [ Glancing at him rapidly .
Well -- no doubt he has run through all his property long-ago ;
and he can scarcely write a new book every year -- eh ?
So I really can_ _n't see what is to become of him . Brack .
Perhaps I can give you some information on that point . Tesman .
Indeed !
Brack . You must remember that his relations have a good deal of influence . Tesman .
At=one=time they called him the hope of the family . Tesman .
At one-time , yes !
But he has put an end to all that . Hedda .
Who knows ? [ With a slight smile .
] I hear they have reclaimed him up at Sheriff Elvsted's -- Brack .
And then this book that he has published -- Tesman .
Well well , I hope to goodness they may find something for him to do .
I have just written to him .
I asked him to come and see us this evening , Hedda dear .
Brack . But my dear fellow , you are booked for my bachelor's party this evening .
You promised on the pier last night . Hedda .
Had you forgotten , Tesman ? Tesman .
Yes , I had utterly forgotten . Brack .
But it does_ _n't matter , for you may be sure he will_ _n't come . Tesman .
What makes you think that ?
Eh ?
Brack . [ With a little hesitation , rising and resting his hands on the back of his chair .
] My dear Tesman -- and you too , Mrs.=Tesman -- I think I ought not to keep you in the dark about something that -- that --
Tesman . That concerns Eilert -- ?
Brack . Both you and him .
Tesman .
Well , my dear Judge , out with it .
Brack . You must be prepared to find your appointment deferred longer than you desired or expected .
Tesman . [ Jumping up uneasily . ] Is there some hitch about it ?
Eh ?
Brack . The nomination may perhaps be made conditional on the result of a competition -- Tesman .
Competition !
Think of that , Hedda !
Hedda . [ Leans further back in the chair . ] Aha -- aha ! Tesman .
But who can my competitor be ?
Surely not -- ?
Brack . Yes , precisely -- Eilert=Lovborg .
Tesman . [ Clasping his hands .
] No , no -- it_ _s quite impossible !
Eh ?
Brack . H'm -- that is what it may come to , all=the=same .
Tesman . Well but , Judge Brack -- it would show the most incredible lack of consideration for me . [ Gesticulates with his arms .
] For -- just think -- I_ _m a married man !
We have married on the strength of these prospects , Hedda and I ;
and run deep into debt ;
and borrowed money from Aunt=Julia too .
Good=heavens , they had as good as promised me the appointment .
Eh ?
Brack . Well , well , well -- no doubt you will get it in the end ;
only after a contest .
Why , my dearest Hedda , how can you be so indifferent about it ? Hedda .
[ As before . ] I am not at=all indifferent .
I am most eager to see who wins . Brack .
In any case , Mrs.=Tesman , it is best that you should know how matters stand . I mean -- before you set about the little purchases I hear you are threatening .
Hedda . This can make no difference .
Brack . Indeed !
Then I have no=more to say .
Good-bye ! [ To Tesman .
[ Reclining , holds out her hand . ] Good-bye , Judge ;
and be sure you call in the afternoon .
Brack . Many thanks .
Good-bye , good-bye !
Tesman . [ Accompanying him to the door . ] Good-bye my dear Judge !
You must really excuse me -- [ Judge Brack goes out by the hall door . Tesman .
[ Crosses the room . ] Oh=Hedda -- one should never rush into adventures .
Eh ?
Hedda . [ Looks at him , smiling . ] Do you do that ?
Perhaps you are right there .
Tesman . Well -- at all events , we have our delightful home , Hedda !
Fancy , the home we both dreamed of -- the home we were in=love with , I may almost say .
Eh ?
Hedda . [ Rising slowly and wearily . ] It was part of our compact that we were to go into society -- to keep open house .
Tesman .
Yes , if you only knew how I had been looking forward to it !
Fancy -- to see you as hostess -- in a select circle !
Eh ?
Well , well , well -- for the present we shall have to get on without society , Hedda -- only to invite Aunt Julia now=and=then .
-- Oh , I intended you to lead such an utterly different life , dear -- !
Hedda . Of=course I can_ _not have my man in livery just yet . Tesman .
Oh , no , unfortunately .
It would be out=of the question for us to keep a footman , you know .
Hedda . And the saddle-horse I was to have had --
Tesman . [ Aghast . ] The saddle-horse !
Hedda . -- I suppose I must not think of that now . Tesman .
Good=heavens , no ! -- that_ _s as clear as daylight ! Hedda .
[ Beaming . ] Oh thank heaven for that !
What is it , Hedda .
Eh ?
Hedda . [ In the middle doorway , looks at him with covert scorn . ] My pistols , George .
Tesman . [ In alarm . ] Your pistols !
Hedda . [ With cold eyes . ] General=Gabler's pistols .
[ She goes out through the inner room , to the left .
Tesman .
[ Rushes up=to the middle doorway and calls after her : ] No , for heaven's sake , Hedda darling -- do_ _n't touch those dangerous things !
For my sake Hedda !
Eh ?
Act Second .
The room at the Tesmans' as=in the first Act , except=that the piano has been removed , and an elegant little writing-table with the book-shelves put in its place .
A smaller table stands near the sofa on the left .
Most of the bouquets have been taken away . Mrs .
Elvsted's bouquet is upon the large table in=front .
-- It is afternoon .
Hedda , dressed to receive callers , is alone in the room .
She stands by the open glass door , loading a revolver .
The fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the writing- table .
Hedda .
[ Looks down the garden , and calls : ] So you are here again , Judge ! Brack .
[ Is heard calling from a distance . ] As you see , Mrs.=Tesman !
Hedda . [ Raises the pistol and points . ] Now=I_ _ll shoot you , Judge Brack !
Brack . [ Calling unseen . ] No , no , no !
Do_ _n't stand aiming at me ! Hedda .
This is what comes of sneaking in by the back way . ( 7 ) [ She fires . Brack .
[ Nearer .
] Are you out=of your senses -- ! Hedda .
Dear me -- did I happen to hit you ?
Brack . [ Still outside . ] I wish you would let these pranks alone !
Hedda . Come in then , Judge .
Judge Brack , dressed as=though for a men's party , enters by the glass door .
He carries a light overcoat over his arm.
Brack .
What the deuce -- have_ _n't you tired of that sport , yet ?
What are you shooting at ?
Hedda . Oh , I am only firing in the air . Brack .
[ Gently takes the pistol out=of her hand .
] Allow me , madam ! [ Looks at it .
] Ah -- I know this pistol well ! [ Looks around .
] Where is the case ?
Ah , here it is . [ Lays the pistol in it , and shuts it . ] Now we will_ _n't play at that game any=more to-day . Hedda .
Then what in heaven's name would you have me do with myself ?
Brack . Have you had no visitors ?
Hedda . [ Closing the glass door . ] Not one .
I suppose all our set are still out of town .
Brack . And is Tesman not at home either ?
Hedda . [ At the writing-table , putting the pistol-case in a drawer which she shuts .
] No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch ;
he did_ _n't expect you so early .
Brack . H'm -- how stupid of me not to have thought of that !
Hedda .
[ Turning her head to look at him . ] Why stupid ? Brack .
Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little -- earlier .
Hedda . [ Crossing the room . ] Then you would have found no=one to receive you ;
for I have been in my room changing my dress ever=since lunch . Brack .
And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley through ? Hedda .
You have forgotten to arrange one .
Brack . That was another piece of stupidity . Hedda .
Well , we must just settle down here -- and wait .
Tesman is not likely to be back for some time yet . Brack . Never mind ;
I shall not be impatient .
Hedda seats herself in the corner of the sofa .
Brack lays his overcoat over the back of the nearest chair , and sits down , but keeps his hat in his hand .
A short silence .
They look at each other .
Hedda .
Well ?
Brack . [ In the same tone .
] Well ? Hedda . I spoke first . Brack .
[ Bending a little forward . ] Come , let us have a cosy little chat , Mrs. Hedda . ( 8 )
Hedda . [ Leaning further back in the sofa . ] Does it not seem like a whole eternity since our last talk ?
You mean since out last confidential talk ?
Our last _tete-a-tete_ ?
Hedda . Well yes -- since you put it so .
Brack .
Not a day passed but I have wished that you were home again . Hedda .
And I have done nothing but wish the same thing .
Brack . You ?
Really , Mrs.=Hedda ?
And I thought you had been enjoying your tour so much ! Hedda .
Oh yes , you may be sure of that !
Brack . But Tesman's letters spoke of nothing but happiness . Hedda .
Oh , Tesman !
You see , he thinks nothing is so delightful as grubbing in libraries and making copies of old parchments , or whatever you call them .
Brack . [ With a smile of malice .
] Well , that is his vocation in life -- or part of it at=any=rate .
Hedda .
Yes , of=course ;
and no doubt when it_ _s your vocation -- .
But _I_ !
Oh , my dear Mr.=Brack , how mortally bored I have been .
Brack . [ Sympathetically .
] Do you really say so ?
In downright earnest ? Hedda . Yes , you can surely understand it -- !
To go for six whole months without meeting a soul that knew anything of our circle , or could talk about things we were interested in . Brack .
Yes , yes -- I too should feel that a deprivation .
Hedda . And then , what I found most intolerable of all --
Brack . Well ?
Hedda . -- was being everlastingly in the company of -- one and the same person --
Brack . [ With a nod of assent .
] Morning , noon , and night , yes -- at all possible times and seasons .
Hedda . I said « everlastingly . »
Brack . Just=so .
But I should have thought , with our excellent Tesman , one could -- Hedda .
Tesman is -- a specialist , my dear Judge .
Brack . Undeniable .
Hedda . And specialists are not at=all amusing to travel with .
Not in the long run at=any=rate .
Brack . Not even -- the specialist one happens to love ?
Hedda . Faugh -- do_ _n't use that sickening word ! Brack .
[ Taken aback . ] What do you say , Mrs.=Hedda ?
Hedda . [ Half laughing , half irritated . ] You should just try it !
To hear of nothing but the history of civilisation , morning , noon , and night --
Brack . Everlastingly .
Hedda . Yes yes yes !
And then all this about the domestic industry of the middle ages -- !
That's the most disgusting part of it !
Brack . [ Looks searchingly at her . ] But tell me -- in that case , how am I to understand your -- ?
H'm --
Hedda . My accepting George=Tesman , you mean ?
Brack . Well , let us put it so .
Hedda . Good=heavens , do you see anything so wonderful in that ?
Brack . Yes and no -- Mrs.=Hedda . Hedda .
I had positively danced myself tired , my dear Judge .
My day was done -- [ With a slight shudder .
] Oh no -- I will_ _n't say that ;
nor think it either ! Brack . You have assuredly no reason to .
His correctness and respectability are beyond all question .
Hedda .
And I do_ _n't see anything absolutely ridiculous about him .
-- Do you ? Brack .
Ridiculous ?
N -- no -- I should_ _n't exactly say so --
Hedda . Well -- and his powers of research , at all events , are untiring .
-- I see no reason why he should not one day come to the front , after all .
[ With an expression of fatigue . ] Yes , so I did .
-- And then , since he was bent , at all hazards , on being allowed to provide for me -- I really do_ _n't know why I should not have accepted his offer ?
Brack .
No -- if you look at it in that light --
[ Laughing . ] Well , I can_ _n't answer for all the rest ;
but as=for myself , you know quite well that I have always entertained a -- a certain respect for the marriage tie -- for marriage as an institution , Mrs.=Hedda .
Hedda . [ Jestingly .
] Oh , I assure you I have never cherished any hopes with respect to you . Brack .
Of the master of the house , do you mean ? Brack .
[ Bowing . ] Frankly -- of the mistress first=of=all ;
but of=course of the master too , in the second place .
Yes , I have many a time longed for some one to make a third on our travels .
Oh -- those railway-carriage _tete-a-tetes_ -- !
Brack . Fortunately your wedding journey is over now .
Hedda . [ Shaking her head .
] Not by a long -- long way .
I have only arrived at a station on the line .
Brack . Well , then the passengers jump out and move about a little , Mrs.=Hedda .
Hedda . I never jump out .
Brack .
Really ?
Hedda . No -- because there is always some one standing by to --
Brack . [ Laughing .
] To look at your ankles , do you mean ?
Hedda . Precisely . Brack . Well but , dear me --
Hedda . [ With a gesture of repulsion . ] I will_ _n't have it .
I would rather keep my seat where I happen to be -- and continue the _tete-a-tete_ .
Brack .
But suppose a third person were to jump in and join the couple .
Hedda . Ah -- that is quite another matter !
Brack . A trusted , sympathetic friend --
Hedda . -- with a fund of conversation on all sorts of lively topics -- Brack .
-- and not the least bit of a specialist ! Hedda .
[ With an audible sigh . ] Yes , that would be a relief indeed . Brack .
[ Hears the front door open , and glances in that direction . ] The triangle is completed .
Hedda . [ Half aloud . ] And on goes the train .
George=tesman , in a grey walking-suit , with a soft felt hat , enters from the hall .
He has a=number=of unbound books under his arm and in his pockets .
Tesman .
[ Goes up=to the table beside the corner settee . ] Ouf -- what a load for a warm day -- all these books . [ Lays them on the table .
] I_ _m positively perspiring , Hedda .
Hallo -- are you there already , my dear Judge ?
Eh ?
Berta did_ _n't tell me .
Brack . [ Rising . ] I came in through the garden . Hedda .
What books have you got there ? Tesman . [ Stands looking them through .
] Some new books on my special subjects -- quite indispensable to me . Hedda .
Your special subjects ?
Brack . Yes , books on his special subjects , Mrs.=Tesman .
[ Brack and Hedda exchange a confidential smile .
Hedda .
Do you need still more books on your special subjects ?
Tesman . Yes , my dear Hedda , one can never have too many of them .
Of=course one must keep up with all that is written and published .
Hedda . Yes , I suppose one must . Tesman .
[ Searching among his books . ] And look here -- I have got hold of Eilert Lovborg's new book too . [ Offering it to her .
] Perhaps you would like to glance through it , Hedda ?
Eh ?
Hedda . No , thank you .
Or rather -- afterwards perhaps .
Tesman . I looked into it a little on the way home .
Brack . Well , what do you think of it -- as a specialist ?
Tesman . I think it shows quite remarkable soundness of judgment .
He never wrote like that before . [ Putting the books together .
] Now=I shall take all these into my study .
I_ _m longing to cut the leaves -- !
And then I must change my clothes . [ To Brack .
] I suppose we needn't start just yet ?
Eh ?
Brack . Oh , dear no -- there is not the slightest hurry .
Tesman . Well then , I will take my time . [ Is going with his books , but stops in the doorway and turns .
Not coming ?
Is it that affair of the bonnet that keeps her away ?
Tesman . Oh , not at=all .
How could you think such a thing of Aunt=Julia ?
Just fancy -- !
The fact is , Aunt=Rina is very ill .
Hedda . She always is .
Tesman . Yes , but to-day she is much worse than usual , poor dear . Hedda .
Oh , then it_ _s only natural that her sister should remain with her .
I must bear my disappointment .
Tesman . And you can_ _n't imagine , dear , how delighted Aunt=Julia seemed to be -- because you had come home looking so flourishing !
Hedda . [ Half aloud , rising .
] Oh , those everlasting Aunts !
Tesman . What ? Hedda . [ Going to the glass door . ] Nothing .
Tesman .
Oh , all=right . [ He goes through the inner room , out to the right . Brack .
What bonnet were you talking about ?
Hedda . Oh , it was a little episode with Miss=Tesman this morning .
She had laid down her bonnet on the chair there -- [ Looks at him and smiles .
[ Shaking his head . ] Now my dear Mrs.=Hedda , how could you do such a thing ?
To the excellent old lady , too ! Hedda .
[ Nervously crossing the room . ] Well , you see -- these impulses come over me all=of=a=sudden ;
and I can_ _not resist them . [ Throws herself down in the easy-chair by the stove . ] Oh , I do_ _n't know how to explain it .
Brack . [ Behind the easy-chair .
[ Looking straight before her . ] I know of no reason why I should be -- happy .
Perhaps you can give me one ? Brack .
Well-amongst other things , because you have got exactly the home you had set your heart on . Hedda .
[ Looks up at him and laughs . ] Do you too believe in that legend ? Brack .
Is there nothing in it , then ?
Hedda . Oh yes , there is something in it .
Brack . Well ?
I , unfortunately , had to go quite a different way . Hedda .
That's true .
I know you were going a different way last summer .
Brack . [ Laughing . ] Oh fie , Mrs.=Hedda !
Well , then -- you and Tesman -- ?
Hedda . Well , we happened to pass here one evening ;
Tesman , poor fellow , was writhing in the agony of having to find conversation ;
so I took pity on the learned man --
Brack . [ Smiles doubtfully .
] You took pity ?
H'm --
Hedda . Yes , I really did .
And so -- to help him out=of his torment -- I happened to say , in pure thoughtlessness , that I should like to live in this villa .
Brack .
No=more than that ? Hedda .
Not that evening . Brack . But afterwards ?
Hedda .
Yes , my thoughtlessness had consequences , my dear Judge .
Brack . Unfortunately that too often happens , Mrs.=Hedda .
Hedda . Thanks !
So you see it was this enthusiasm for Secretary Falk's villa that first constituted a bond of sympathy between George=Tesman and me .
From that came our engagement and our marriage , and our wedding journey , and all the rest of it .
This is exquisite !
And you really cared not a rap about it all=the=time ? Hedda .
No , heaven knows I did_ _n't .
Brack . But now ?
Now that we have made it so homelike for you ?
Hedda . Uh -- the rooms all seem to smell of lavender and dried rose-leaves .
-- But perhaps it_ _s Aunt=Julia that has brought that scent with her .
Yes , there is an odour of mortality about it .
It reminds me of a bouquet -- the day after the ball . [ Clasps her hands behind her head , leans back in her chair and looks at him .
A vocation -- that should attract me ?
Brack . If=possible , of=course .
Hedda . Heaven knows what sort of a vocation that could be .
I often wonder whether -- [ Breaking off . ] But that would never do either .
Brack .
Who can tell ?
Let me hear what it is . Hedda . Whether I might not get Tesman to go into politics , I mean . Brack .
[ Laughing . ] Tesman ?
No really now , political life is not the thing for him -- not at=all in his line .
Hedda . No , I daresay not .
-- But if I could get him into it all=the=same ? Brack .
Why -- what satisfaction could you find in that ?
If he is not fitted for that sort of thing , why should you want to drive him into it ? Hedda .
Because I am bored , I tell you ! [ After a pause .
] So you think it quite out=of the question that Tesman should ever get into the ministry ?
Brack . H'm -- you see , my dear Mrs.=Hedda -- to get into the ministry , he would have to be a tolerably rich man .
Hedda . [ Rising impatiently .
] Yes , there we have it ! It is this genteel poverty I have managed to drop into -- ! [ Crosses the room . ] That is what makes life so pitiable !
So utterly ludicrous !
-- For that_ _s what it is .
Brack . Now _I_ should say the fault lay elsewhere . Hedda .
Where , then ?
Brack . You have never gone through any really stimulating experience . Hedda .
Anything serious , you mean ?
Brack . Yes , you may call it so .
But now you may perhaps have one in-store .
Hedda . [ Tossing her head . ] Oh , you_ _re thinking of the annoyances about this wretched professorship !
But that must be Tesman's own affair .
I assure you I shall not waste a thought upon it . Brack .
No , no , I daresay not .
But suppose now that what people call -- in elegant language -- a solemn responsibility were to come upon you ? [ Smiling .
] A new responsibility , Mrs.=Hedda ? Hedda .
[ Angrily . ] Be quiet !
Nothing of that sort will ever happen !
Brack . [ Warily . ] We will speak of this again a year hence -- at the very outside . Hedda .
[ Curtly . ] I have no turn for anything of the sort , Judge Brack .
No responsibilities for me !
Brack . Are you so unlike the generality of women as=to have no turn for duties which -- ?
Hedda . [ Beside the glass door . ] Oh , be quiet , I tell you !
-- I often think there is only one thing in the world I have any turn for .
Brack . [ Drawing near to her . ] And what is that , if I may ask ?
Hedda . [ Stands looking out .
] Boring myself to death .
Now you know it . [ Turns , looks towards the inner room , and laughs . ] Yes , as I thought !
Here comes the Professor . Brack . [ Softly , in a tone of warning .
] Come , come , come , Mrs.=Hedda !
George=tesman , dressed for the party , with his gloves and hat in his hand , enters from the right through the inner room .
Tesman .
Hedda , has no message come from Eilert=Lovborg ?
Eh ?
Hedda . No. Tesman .
Then you_ _ll see he_ _ll be here presently . Brack .
Do you really think he will come ?
Tesman . Yes , I am almost sure of it .
For what you were telling us this morning must have been a mere floating rumour . Brack .
You think so ?
Tesman . At=any=rate , Aunt=Julia said she did not believe for a moment that he would ever stand in my way again .
Fancy that !
Brack . Well then , that_ _s all=right .
Tesman . [ Placing his hat and gloves on a chair on the right . ] Yes , but you must really let me wait for him as=long=as possible .
Brack . We have plenty=of time yet .
None of my guests will arrive before seven or half-past .
Tesman . Then meanwhile we can keep Hedda company , and see what happens .
Eh ?
[ Offering to take his things . ] Oh , allow me , Mrs.=Tesman !
-- What do you mean by « At=the=worst » ?
Hedda . If he will_ _n't go with you and Tesman .
Tesman . [ Looks dubiously at her . ] But , Hedda dear -- do you think it would quite do for him to remain here with you ?
Eh ?
Remember , Aunt=Julia can_ _n't come .
Hedda . No , but Mrs.=Elvsted is coming .
We three can have a cup of tea together . Tesman .
Oh yes , that will be all=right .
Brack . [ Smiling . ] And that would perhaps be the safest plan for him .
Hedda . Why so ?
Brack . Well , you know , Mrs.=Tesman , how you used to gird at my little bachelor parties .
You declared they were adapted only for men of the strictest principles .
Hedda . But no doubt Mr.=Lovborg's principles are strict enough now .
A converted sinner -- [ Berta appears at the hall door .
Berta .
There's a gentleman asking if you are at-home , ma'am --
Hedda . Well , show him in .
Tesman . [ Softly . ] I_ _m sure it is he !
Fancy that !
Eilert=lovborg enters from the hall .
He is slim and lean ;
of the same age as Tesman , but looks older and somewhat worn-out .
His hair and beard are of a blackish brown , his face long and pale , but with patches of colour on the cheeks .
He is dressed in a well-cut black visiting suit , quite new .
He has dark gloves and a silk hat .
He stops near the door , and makes a rapid bow , seeming somewhat embarrassed .
Tesman .
[ Goes up=to him and shakes him warmly by the hand . ] Well , my dear Eilert -- so at=last we meet again !
Eilert=lovborg . [ Speaks in a subdued voice .
] Thanks for your letter , Tesman . [ Approaching Hedda . ] Will you too shake hands with me , Mrs.=Tesman ? Hedda . [ Taking his hand .
] I am glad to see you , Mr.=Lovborg . [ With a motion of her hand .
] I do_ _n't know whether you two gentlemen -- ?
Lovborg . [ Bowing slightly . ] Judge Brack , I think .
Brack . [ Doing likewise .
] Oh yes , -- in the old days --
Tesman . [ To Lovborg , with his hands on his shoulders . ] And now you must make yourself entirely at-home , Eilert !
Must_ _n't he , Hedda ?
-- For I hear you are going to settle in town again ?
Eh ?
Lovborg . Yes , I am .
Tesman . Quite right , quite right .
Let me tell you , I have got hold of your new book ;
but I have_ _n't had time to read it yet .
Lovborg .
You may spare yourself the trouble .
Tesman . Why so ? Lovborg . Because there is very little in it .
Tesman . Just fancy -- how can you say so ?
Brack . But it has been very much-praised , I hear .
Lovborg . That was what I wanted ;
so I put nothing into the book but what every one would agree with . Brack .
Very wise of you .
Tesman . Well but , my dear Eilert -- !
Lovborg . For now I mean to win myself a position again -- to make a fresh start .
Tesman .
[ A little embarrassed . ] Ah , that is what you wish to do ?
Eh ?
Lovborg . [ Smiling , lays down his hat , and draws a packet wrapped in paper , from his coat pocket . ] But when this=one appears , George=Tesman , you will have to read it .
For this is the real book -- the book I have put my true self into .
Tesman . Indeed ?
And what is it ?
Lovborg . It is the continuation .
Tesman . The continuation ?
Of what ?
Lovborg . Of the book .
Tesman . Of the new book ?
Lovborg . Of=course .
Tesman . Why , my dear Eilert -- does it not come down to our own days ?
Lovborg . Yes , it does ;
and this=one deals with the future .
Tesman . With the future !
But , good=heavens , we know nothing of the future !
Lovborg . No ;
but there is a thing or two to be said about it all=the=same . [ Opens the packet .
] Look here -- Tesman .
Why , that_ _s not your handwriting .
Lovborg .
I dictated it . [ Turning over the pages . ] It falls into two sections .
The first deals with the civilising forces of the future .
And here is the second -- [ running through the pages towards the end ] -- forecasting the probable line of development .
Tesman . How odd now !
I should never have thought of writing anything of that sort . Hedda .
[ At the glass door , drumming on the pane . ] H'm -- . I daresay not .
That was very good of you , Eilert .
But this evening -- ? [ Looking back at Brack .
] I do_ _n't see how we can manage it -- Lovborg .
Well then , some=other time .
There is no hurry . Brack .
I must tell you , Mr.=Lovborg -- there is a little gathering at my house this evening -- mainly in honour of Tesman , you know --
Lovborg . [ Looking for his hat .
] Oh -- then I will_ _n't detain you -- Brack .
No , but listen -- will you not do me the favour of joining us ?
Lovborg . [ Curtly and decidedly .
] No , I can_ _n't -- thank you very much .
Brack .
Oh , nonsense -- do !
We shall be quite a select little circle .
And I assure you we shall have a « lively time , » as Mrs.=Hed -- as Mrs.=Tesman says .
Lovborg . I have no doubt of it .
But nevertheless --
Brack . And then you might bring your manuscript with you , and read it to Tesman at my house .
I could give you a room to yourselves .
Tesman . Yes , think of that , Eilert , -- why should_ _n't you ?
Eh ?
Hedda . [ Interposing . ] But , Tesman , if Mr.=Lovborg would really rather not !
I am sure Mr.=Lovborg is much=more inclined to remain here and have supper with me .
Lovborg . [ Looking at her . ] With you , Mrs.=Tesman ?
Hedda . And with Mrs.=Elvsted .
Lovborg .
Ah -- [ Lightly . ] I saw her for a moment this morning .
Hedda .
Did you ?
Well , she is coming this evening .
So you see you are almost bound to remain , Mr.=Lovborg , or she will have no=one to see her home .
Lovborg . That's true .
Many thanks , Mrs.=Tesman -- in that case I will remain .
Hedda . Then I have one or two orders to give the servant --
[ She goes to the hall door and rings .
Berta enters .
Hedda talks to her in a whisper , and points towards the inner room .
Berta nods and goes out again .
Tesman .
[ At the same time , to Lovborg . ] Tell me , Eilert -- is it this new subject -- the future -- that you are going to lecture about ?
Lovborg . Yes .
Tesman . They told me at the bookseller's that you are going to deliver a course of lectures this autumn .
Lovborg . That is my intention .
I hope you will_ _n't take it ill , Tesman .
Tesman . Oh no , not in the least !
But -- ?
Lovborg . I can quite understand that it must be very disagreeable to you . Tesman . [ Cast down .
But I shall wait till you have received your appointment .
Tesman . Will you wait ?
Yes but -- yes but -- are you not going to compete with me ?
Eh ?
Lovborg . No ;
it is only the moral victory I care for .
Tesman .
Why , bless me -- then Aunt=Julia was right after all !
Oh yes -- I knew it !
Hedda !
Just fancy -- Eilert=Lovborg is not going to stand in our way !
Hedda . [ Curtly .
] Our way ? Pray leave me out=of the question .
[ She goes up towards the inner room , where Berta is placing a tray with decanters and glasses on the table .
Hedda nods approval , and comes forward again .
Berta goes out .
Tesman .
[ At the same time . ] And you , Judge Brack -- what do you say to this ?
Eh ?
Brack . Well , I say that a moral victory -- h'm -- may be all very fine --
Tesman . Yes , certainly .
But all=the=same --
Hedda . [ Looking at Tesman with a cold smile . ] You stand there looking as=if you were thunderstruck --
Tesman . Yes -- so I am -- I almost think -- Brack .
Do_ _n't you see , Mrs.=Tesman , a thunderstorm has just passed over ?
Hedda . [ Pointing towards the room . ] Will you not take a glass of cold punch , gentlemen ?
Brack . [ Looking at his watch . ] A stirrup-cup ?
Yes , it would_ _n't come amiss .
Tesman . A capital idea , Hedda !
Just the thing !
Now that the weight has been taken off my mind --
Hedda . Will you not join them , Mr.=Lovborg ?
Lovborg . [ With a gesture of refusal . ] No , thank you .
Nothing for me .
Perhaps not for everyone .
Hedda . I will deep Mr.=Lovborg company in the meantime .
Tesman . Yes , yes , Hedda dear , do .
[ He and Brack go into the inner room , seat themselves , drink punch , smoke cigarettes , and carry on a lively conversation during what follows .
Eilert=lovborg remains standing beside the stove .
Hedda goes to the writing-table .
Hedda .
[ Raising he voice a little . ] Do you care to look at some photographs , Mr.=Lovborg ?
You know Tesman and I made a tour in they Tyrol on our way home ?
[ She takes up an album , and places it on the table beside the sofa , in the further corner of which she seats herself .
Eilert Lovborg approaches , stops , and looks at her .
Then he takes a chair and seats himself to her left .
Hedda .
[ Opening the album .
] Do you see this range of mountains , Mr.=Lovborg ?
It_ _s the Ortler group . Tesman has written the name underneath .
Here it is : « The Ortler group near Meran . »
Lovborg . [ Who has never taken his eyes off her , says softly and slowly : ] Hedda -- Gabler !
Hedda . [ Glancing hastily at him .
] Ah !
Hush ! Lovborg . [ Repeats softly . ] Hedda=Gabler !
Hedda . [ Looking at the album .
] That was my name in the old days -- when we two knew each=other .
[ Still turning over the pages . ] Yes , you must .
And I think you ought=to practise in time .
The sooner the better , I should say . Lovborg .
[ In a tone of indignation . ] Hedda=Gabler married ?
And married to -- George=Tesman !
Hedda . Yes -- so the world goes .
Lovborg . Oh , Hedda , Hedda -- how could you ( 9 ) throw yourself away !
Hedda . [ Looks sharply at him .
] What ?
I can_ _n't allow this ! Lovborg .
What do you mean ? [ Tesman comes into the room and goes towards the sofa . Hedda .
[ Hears him coming and says in an indifferent tone . ] And this is a view from the Val=d'=Ampezzo , Mr.=Lovborg .
Just look at these peaks ! [ Looks affectionately up at Tesman . ] What's the name of these curious peaks , dear ?
Tesman .
Let me see .
Oh , those are the Dolomites . Hedda .
Yes , that_ _s it !
-- Those are the Dolomites , Mr.=Lovborg .
Tesman . Hedda , dear , -- I only wanted to ask whether I should_ _n't bring you a little punch after all ?
For yourself at=any=rate -- eh ?
Hedda .
Yes , do , please ;
and perhaps a=few biscuits .
Tesman .
No cigarettes ?
Hedda . No.
Tesman . Very well . [ He goes into the inner room and out to the right .
Brack sits in the inner room , and keeps an eye from time to time on Hedda and Lovborg .
Lovborg .
[ Softly , as before . ] Answer me , Hedda -- how could you go and do this ?
Hedda . [ Apparently absorbed in the album . ] If you continue to say _du_ to me I will_ _n't talk to you .
Lovborg . May I not say _du_ even when we are alone ?
Hedda .
No. You may think it ;
but you must_ _n't say it .
Lovborg . Ah , I understand .
It is an offence against George=Tesman , whom you ( 10 ) -- love .
Hedda . [ Glances at him and smiles .
] Love ? What an idea !
Lovborg .
You do_ _n't love him then ! Hedda .
But I will_ _n't hear of any sort of unfaithfulness !
Remember that . Lovborg . Hedda -- answer me one thing --
Hedda .
Hush ! [ Tesman enters with a small tray from the inner room .
Tesman .
Here you are !
Is_ _n't this tempting ? [ He puts the tray on the table . Hedda . Why do you bring it yourself ?
Tesman .
[ Filling the glasses .
But you have poured out two glasses .
Mr.=Lovborg said he would_ _n't have any --
Tesman . No , but Mrs.=Elvsted will soon be here , will_ _n't she ?
Hedda . Yes , by-the-bye -- Mrs.=Elvsted --
Tesman . Had you forgotten her ?
Eh ?
Hedda . We were so absorbed in these photographs . [ Shows him a picture .
] Do you remember this little village ? Tesman .
Oh , it_ _s that one just below the Brenner=Pass .
It was there we passed the night -- Hedda .
-- and met that lively party of tourists . Tesman .
Yes , that was the place .
Fancy -- if we could only have had you with us , Eilert !
Eh ?
[ He returns to the inner room and sits beside Brack .
Lovborg . Answer me one thing , Hedda --
Hedda . Well ?
Lovborg . Was there no love in your friendship for me either ?
Not a spark -- not a tinge of love in it ? Hedda .
I wonder if there was ?
To me it seems as=though we were two good comrades -- two thoroughly intimate friends . [ Smilingly .
] You especially were frankness itself .
Lovborg . It was you that made me so .
Hedda . As I look back upon it all , I think there was really something beautiful , something fascinating -- something daring -- in -- in that secret intimacy -- that comradeship which no living creature so much as dreamed of .
Lovborg . Yes , yes , Hedda !
Was there not ?
-- When I used to come to your father's in the afternoon -- and the General sat over at the window reading his papers -- with his back towards us --
Hedda . And we two on the corner sofa --
Lovborg . Always with the same illustrated paper before us --
Hedda . For=want=of an album , yes .
Lovborg .
Yes , Hedda , and when I made my confessions to you -- told you about myself , things that at that time no=one else knew !
There I would sit and tell you of my escapades -- my days and nights of devilment .
Oh , Hedda -- what was the power in you that forced me to confess these things ?
Hedda . Do you think it was any power in me ?
Lovborg . How else can I explain it ?
And all those -- those roundabout questions you used to put to me -- Hedda .
Which you understood so particularly well --
Lovborg . How could you sit and question me like that ?
Question me quite frankly --
Hedda . In roundabout terms , please observe . Lovborg .
Yes , but frankly nevertheless .
Cross-question me about -- all that sort of thing ?
Hedda . And how could you answer , Mr.=Lovborg ? Lovborg .
Yes , that is just what I can_ _n't understand -- in looking back upon it .
But tell me now , Hedda -- was there not love at the bottom of our friendship ?
On your side , did you not feel as=though you might purge my stains away -- if I made you my confessor ?
Was it not so ?
Hedda . No , not=quite .
Lovborg . What was you motive , then ?
Hedda . Do think it quite incomprehensible that a young girl -- when it can be done -- without any one knowing --
Lovborg . Well ?
Hedda . -- should be glad to have a peep , now=and=then , into a world which -- ?
Lovborg . Which -- ?
Hedda . -- which she is forbidden to know anything about ?
Lovborg .
So=that was it ? Hedda .
Partly . Partly -- I almost think .
Lovborg . Comradeship in the thirst for life .
But why should not that , at any rate , have continued ?
Hedda . The fault was yours .
Lovborg . It was you that broke with me .
Hedda . Yes , when our friendship threatened to develop into something more serious .
Shame upon you , Eilert=Lovborg ! How could you think of wronging your -- your frank comrade . Lovborg .
[ Clenches his hands . ] Oh , why did you not carry out your threat ?
Why did you not shoot me down ? Hedda .
Because I have such a dread of scandal .
Lovborg .
Yes , Hedda , you are a coward at heart .
Hedda . A terrible coward . [ Changing her tone .
] But it was a lucky thing for you .
And now you have found ample consolation at the Elvsteds' .
Lovborg . I know what Thea has confided to you .
Hedda . And perhaps you have confided to her something about us ?
Lovborg . Not a word .
She is too stupid to understand anything of that sort .
Hedda .
Stupid ? Lovborg .
She is stupid about matters of that sort .
Hedda . And I am cowardly . [ Bends over towards him , without looking him in the face , and says more softly : ] But now I will confide something to you .
Lovborg . [ Eagerly .
] Well ? Hedda . The fact that I dared not shoot you down --
Lovborg . Yes !
Hedda .
-- that was not my arrant cowardice -- that evening . Lovborg .
[ Looks at her a moment , understands , and whispers passionately . ] Oh , Hedda !
Hedda=Gabler !
Now I begin to see a hidden reason beneath our comradeship !
You ( 11 ) and I -- !
After all , then , it was your craving for life --
Hedda . [ Softly , with a sharp glance .
] Take care !
Believe nothing of the sort ! [ Twilight has begun to fall .
The hall door is opened from without by Berta .
Hedda .
[ Closes the album with a bang and calls smilingly : ] Ah , at=last !
My darling Thea , -- come along !
Mrs . Elvsted enters from the hall .
She is in evening dress .
The door is closed behind her .
Hedda .
[ On the sofa , stretches out her arms towards her . ] My sweet Thea -- you can_ _n't think how I have been longing for you !
[ Mrs . Elvsted , in passing , exchanges slight salutations with the gentlemen in the inner room , then goes up=to the table and gives Hedda her hand .
Eilert=lovborg has risen .
He and Mrs . Elvsted greet each=other with a silent nod .
Mrs .
Elvsted . Ought I to go in and talk to your husband for a moment ? Hedda .
Oh , not at=all .
Leave those two alone .
They will soon be going .
Mrs . Elvsted . Are they going out ?
Hedda . Yes , to a supper-party .
Mrs . Elvsted . [ Quickly , to Lovborg . ] Not you ?
Lovborg . No.
Hedda . Mr.=Lovborg remains with us . Mrs .
No , thank you , my little Thea !
Not there !
You_ _ll be good enough to come over here to me .
I will sit between you . Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , just as you please .
[ She goes round the table and seats herself on the sofa on Hedda's right .
Lovborg re-seats himself on his chair .
Lovborg .
[ After a short pause , to Hedda . ] Is not she lovely to look at ? Hedda .
[ Lightly stroking her hair . ] Only to look at !
Lovborg . Yes .
For we two -- she and I -- we are two real comrades .
We have absolute faith in each=other ;
so we can sit and talk with perfect frankness --
Hedda . Not round about , Mr.=Lovborg ?
Lovborg .
Well -- Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Softly clinging close to Hedda . ] Oh , how happy I am , Hedda !
For only think , he says I have inspired him too . Hedda .
[ Looks at her with a smile . ] Ah ! Does he say that , dear ? Lovborg .
And then she is so brave , Mrs.=Tesman ! Mrs . Elvsted .
Good=heavens -- am I brave ? Lovborg .
Exceedingly -- where your comrade is concerned . Hedda . Exceedingly -- where your comrade is concerned .
Hedda . Ah , yes -- courage !
If one only had that !
Lovborg . What then ? What do you mean ?
Hedda . Then life would perhaps be liveable , after all . [ With a sudden change of tone .
No , thanks -- I never take anything of that kind .
Hedda . Well then , you , Mr.=Lovborg .
Lovborg . Nor I , thank you . Mrs .
Elvsted . No , he does_ _n't either .
Hedda . [ Looks fixedly at him .
] But if I say you shall ?
Lovborg . It would be of no use . Hedda . [ Laughing . ] Then=I , poor creature , have no sort of power over you ?
Lovborg . Not in that respect .
Hedda . But seriously , I think you ought=to -- for your own sake . Mrs .
Elvsted .
Why , Hedda -- !
Lovborg . How so ?
Hedda . Or rather on=account=of other people .
Lovborg . Indeed ?
[ Softly . ] Oh please , Hedda -- !
Lovborg . People may suspect what they like -- for the present . Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Joyfully . ] Yes , let them !
Hedda . I saw it plainly in Judge Brack's face a moment ago .
Lovborg . What did you see ?
Hedda . His contemptuous smile , when you dared not go with them into the inner room .
Lovborg . Dared not ?
Of=course I preferred to stop here and talk to you . Mrs . Elvsted .
What could be more natural , Hedda ? Hedda .
But the Judge could not guess that .
And I say , too , the way he smiled and glanced at Tesman when you dared not accept his invitation to this wretched little supper-party of his .
Lovborg .
Dared not !
Do you say I dared not ?
Hedda . _I_ do_ _n't say so . But that was how Judge Brack understood it .
Lovborg . Well , let him . Hedda .
Then you are not going with them ?
Lovborg . I will stay here with you and Thea . Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , Hedda -- how can you doubt that ?
Hedda . [ Smiles and nods approvingly to Lovborg .
] Firm as a rock !
Faithful to your principles , now and for=ever ! Ah , that is how a man should be ! [ Turns to Mrs .
Elvsted and caresses her . ] Well now , what did I tell you , when you came to us this morning in such a state of distraction --
Lovborg . [ Surprised . ] Distraction ! Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Terrified . ] Hedda -- oh Hedda -- ! Hedda .
You can see for yourself !
You have_ _n't the slightest reason to be in such mortal terror -- [ Interrupting herself . ] There !
Now we can all three enjoy ourselves ! Lovborg . [ Who has given a start . ] Ah -- what is all this , Mrs.=Tesman ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh my God , Hedda !
What are you saying ?
What are you doing ?
Hedda . Do_ _n't get excited !
That horrid Judge Brack is sitting watching you .
Lovborg . So she was in mortal terror !
On my account ! Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Softly and piteously . ] Oh , Hedda -- now you have ruined everything !
Lovborg . [ Looks fixedly at her for a moment .
His face is distorted . ] So=that was my comrade's frank confidence in me ? Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Imploringly . ] Oh , my dearest friend -- only let me tell you --
Lovborg . [ Takes one of the glasses of punch , raises it to his lips , and says in a low , husky voice . ] Your health , Thea !
[ He empties the glass , puts it down , and takes the second . Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Softly . ] Oh , Hedda , Hedda -- how could you do this ? Hedda .
_I_ do it ?
_I_ ?
Are you crazy ?
Lovborg . Here's to your health too , Mrs.=Tesman .
Thanks for the truth .
Hurrah for the truth !
[ He empties the glass and is about to re-fill it .
Hedda . [ Lays her hand on his arm. ] Come , come -- no=more for the present .
Remember you are going out to supper . Mrs .
Elvsted . No , no , no !
Hedda . Hush !
They are sitting watching you .
Lovborg . [ Putting down the glass . ] Now , Thea -- tell me the truth -- Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes .
Lovborg . Did your husband know that you had come after me ? Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Wringing her hands . ] Oh , Hedda -- do you hear what his is asking ?
Lovborg . Was it arranged between you and him that you were to come to town and look after me ?
Perhaps it was the Sheriff himself that urged you to come ?
Aha , my dear -- no doubt he wanted my help in his office !
Or was it at the card-table that he missed me ? Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Softly , in agony . ] Oh , Lovborg , Lovborg -- ! Lovborg .
[ Seizes a glass and is on the point of filling it . ] Here's a glass for the old Sheriff too ! Hedda .
[ Preventing him . ] No=more just now .
Remember , you have to read your manuscript to Tesman .
Lovborg . [ Calmly , putting down the glass . ] It was stupid of me all this .
Thea -- to take it in this way , I mean .
Do_ _n't be angry with me , my dear , dear comrade .
You shall see -- both you and the others -- that if I was fallen once -- now I have risen again !
Thanks=to you , Thea . Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Radiant with joy . ] Oh , heaven be praised -- !
[ Brack has in the meantime looked at his watch .
He and Tesman rise and come into the drawing-room .
Brack .
I suppose it has .
Lovborg . [ Rising . ] Mine too , Judge Brack . Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Softly and imploringly . ] Oh , Lovborg , do_ _n't do it ! Hedda .
[ Pinching her arm. ] They can hear you ! Mrs .
Elvsted . [ With a suppressed shriek .
] Ow ! Lovborg . [ To Brack . ] You were good enough to invite me . Judge Brack .
Well , are you coming after all ?
Lovborg . Yes , many thanks .
Brack . I_ _m delighted --
Fancy -- that will be delightful .
But , Hedda dear , how is Mrs.=Elvsted to get home ?
Eh ?
Hedda . Oh , that can be managed somehow .
Lovborg . [ Looking towards the ladies .
] Mrs.=Elvsted ?
Of=course , I_ _ll come again and fetch her . [ Approaching .
] At ten or thereabouts , Mrs.=Tesman ?
Will that do ? Hedda .
Certainly .
That will do capitally . Tesman . Well , then , that_ _s all=right .
But you must not expect me so early , Hedda .
Elvsted . [ Trying to conceal her anxiety . ] Well then , Mr.=Lovborg -- I shall remain here until you come .
Lovborg . [ With his hat in his hand . ] Pray do , Mrs.=Elvsted .
Brack . And now off goes the excursion train , gentlemen !
I hope we shall have a lively time , as a certain fair lady puts it . Hedda .
Ah , if only the fair lady could be present unseen -- !
Brack . Why unseen ?
Hedda . In=order=to hear a little of your liveliness at first-hand , Judge Brack . Brack .
[ Laughing . ] I should not advise the fair lady to try it .
Tesman . [ Also laughing . ] Come , you_ _re a nice one Hedda !
Fancy that !
Brack . Well , good-bye , good-bye , ladies .
Lovborg . [ Bowing . ] About ten o'clock , then ,
[ Brack , Lovborg , and Tesman go out by the hall door .
At the same time , Berta enters from the inner room with a lighted lamp , which she places on the drawing-room table ; she goes out by=the=way she came .
Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Who has risen and is wandering restlessly about the room .
] Hedda -- Hedda -- what will come of all this ? Hedda .
At ten o'clock -- he will be here .
I can see him already -- with vine- leaves in his hair -- flushed and fearless --
Mrs . Elvsted .
Oh , I hope he may . Hedda .
And then , you see -- then he will have regained control over himself .
Then he will be a free man for all his days . Mrs . Elvsted .
He will come as I see him -- so , and not otherwise ! [ Rises and approaches Thea .
] You may doubt him as=long=as you please ;
_I_ believe in him .
And now we will try --
Mrs . Elvsted . You have some hidden motive in this , Hedda !
Hedda . Yes , I have .
I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human destiny . Mrs .
Elvsted . Have you not the power ?
Hedda . I have not -- and have never had it . Mrs .
Elvsted . Not your husband's ?
Hedda . Do you think that is worth the trouble ?
Oh , if you could only understand how poor I am .
And fate has made you so rich ! [ Clasps her passionately in her arms .
] I think I must burn your hair off after all . Mrs .
Elvsted . Let me go !
Let me go !
I am afraid of you , Hedda !
Berta . [ In the middle doorway . ] Tea is laid in the dining-room , ma'am . Hedda .
Very well .
We are coming
Mrs . Elvsted . No , no , no !
I would rather go home alone !
At=once !
Hedda . Nonsense !
First you shall have a cup of tea , you little stupid .
And then -- at ten o'clock -- Eilert=Lovborg will be here -- with vine-leaves in his hair .
[ She drags Mrs . Elvsted almost by force to the middle doorway .
Act Third .
The room at the Tesmans' .
The curtains are drawn over the middle doorway , and also over the glass door .
The lamp , half turned down , and with a shade over it , is burning on the table .
In the stove , the door of which stands open , there has been a fire , which is now nearly burnt-out .
Mrs .
Elvsted , wrapped in a large shawl , and with her feet upon a foot-rest , sits close to the stove , sunk back in the arm-chair .
Hedda , fully dressed , lies sleeping upon the sofa , with a sofa-blanket over her .
Mrs .
Elvsted . [ After a pause , suddenly sits up in her chair , and listens eagerly .
Then she sinks back again wearily , moaning to herself . ] Not=yet !
-- Oh God -- oh God -- not=yet !
Berta slips cautiously in by the hall door .
She has a letter in her hand .
Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Turns and whispers eagerly . ] Well -- has any one come ?
Berta . [ Softly . ] Yes , a girl has just brought this letter . Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Quickly , holding out her hand .
] A letter !
Give it to me ! Berta . No , it_ _s for Dr.=Tesman , ma'am . Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh , indeed .
Berta . It was Miss=Tesman's servant that brought it .
I_ _ll lay it here on the table . Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , do .
Berta . [ Laying down the letter . ] I think I had better put out the lamp . It_ _s smoking . Mrs .
Elvsted .
Yes , put it out .
It must soon be daylight now .
Berta . [ Putting out the lamp . ] It is daylight already , ma'am . Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , broad day !
And no=one come back yet -- ! Berta .
Lord bless you , ma'am -- I guessed how it would be . Mrs .
Elvsted . You guessed ?
Berta . Yes , when I saw that a certain person had come back to town -- and that he went off with them .
For we_ _ve heard enough about that gentleman before now . Mrs .
Elvsted . Do_ _n't speak so loud .
You will waken Mrs.=Tesman .
Berta . [ Looks towards the sofa and sighs . ] No , no -- let her sleep , poor thing .
Shall_ _n't I put some wood on the fire ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Thanks , not for me .
Berta .
Oh , very well . [ She goes softly out by the hall door . Hedda .
[ Is wakened by the shutting of the door , and looks up . ] What's that -- ? Mrs .
Elvsted . It was only the servant .
Hedda . [ Looking about her . ] Oh , we_ _re here -- !
Elvsted . [ Looks at her watch . ] It_ _s past seven . Hedda .
When did Tesman come home ? Mrs .
Elvsted . He has not come .
Hedda . Not come home yet ? Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Rising . ] No=one has come .
Hedda . Think of our watching and waiting here till four in the morning -- Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Wringing her hands . ] And how I watched and waited for him !
Elvsted . Did you get a little sleep ?
Hedda . Oh yes ; I believe I have slept pretty well .
Have you not ?
Mrs . Elvsted . Not for a moment .
I could_ _n't , Hedda !
-- not to save my life . Hedda .
[ Rises and goes towards her . ] There there there !
There's nothing to be so alarmed about .
I understand quite well what has happened . Mrs .
Elvsted . Well , what do you think ?
Will_ _n't you tell me ?
Hedda . Why , of=course it has been a very late affair at Judge Brack's -- Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , yes -- that is clear enough .
But all=the=same --
Hedda . And then , you see , Tesman has_ _n't cared to come home and ring us up in the middle of the night . [ Laughing .
Elvsted . But in that case -- where can he have gone ?
Hedda . Of=course he has gone to his Aunts' and slept there .
They have his old room ready for him .
Mrs . Elvsted .
No , he can_ _n't be with them for a letter has just come for him from Miss Tesman .
There it lies .
Hedda .
Indeed ? [ Looks at the address . ] Why yes , it_ _s addressed in Aunt=Julia's hand .
Well then , he has remained at Judge Brack's .
And as=for Eilert Lovborg -- he is sitting , with vine leaves in his hair , reading his manuscript . Mrs . Elvsted .
You really are a little blockhead , Thea . Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh yes , I suppose I am . Hedda .
And how mortally tired you look . Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , I am mortally tired .
Hedda . Well then , you must do as I tell you .
You must go into my room and lie down for a little while . Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh no , no -- I should_ _n't be able to sleep . Hedda .
I am sure you would . Mrs .
Elvsted . Well , but you husband is certain to come soon now ;
and then I want to know at=once --
Hedda . I shall take care to let you know when he comes . Mrs .
Elvsted . Do you promise me , Hedda ?
Hedda . Yes , rely upon me .
Just you go in and have a sleep in the meantime . Mrs . Elvsted .
Thanks ;
then I_ _ll try . [ She goes off to the inner room .
[ Hedda goes up=to the glass door and draws back the curtains .
The broad daylight streams into the room .
Then she takes a little hand-glass from the writing-table , looks at herself in it , and arranges her hair .
Next she goes to the hall door and presses the bell-button .
Berta presently appears at the hall door .
Berta .
Did you want anything , ma'am ? Hedda .
Yes ; you must put some more wood in the stove .
I am shivering . Berta .
Bless me -- I_ _ll make up the fire at=once . [ She rakes the embers together and lays a piece of wood upon them ;
then stops and listens .
] That was a ring at the front door , ma'am .
Hedda . Then go to the door .
I will look after the fire .
Berta .
It_ _ll soon burn up . [ She goes out by the hall door .
After a short pause , George=tesman enters from the hall .
He steals on tiptoe towards the middle doorway and is about to slip through the curtains .
Hedda .
[ At the stove , without looking up . ] Good morning . Tesman . [ Turns .
] Hedda ! [ Approaching her .
] Good=heavens -- are you up so early ?
Eh ?
Hedda . Yes , I am up very early this morning .
Tesman . And I never doubted you were still sound asleep !
Fancy that , Hedda !
Hedda . Do_ _n't speak so loud .
Mrs.=Elvsted is resting in my room . Tesman . Has Mrs.=Elvsted been here all-night ?
Hedda . Yes , since no=one came to fetch her .
Tesman . Ah , to be sure . Hedda .
[ Closes the door of the stove and rises .
Have you been anxious about me ?
Eh ?
Hedda . No , I should never think of being anxious .
But I asked if you had enjoyed yourself .
Tesman .
Oh yes , -- for once in a way .
Especially the beginning of the evening ;
for then Eilert read me part of his book .
We arrived more=than an hour too early -- fancy that !
And=Brack had all sorts of arrangements to make -- so Eilert read to me .
Hedda .
[ Seating herself by the table on the right . ] Well ?
Tell me then --
Tesman . [ Sitting on a footstool near the stove . ] Oh , Hedda , you can_ _n't conceive what a book that is going to be !
I believe it is one of the most remarkable things that have ever been written .
Fancy that !
Hedda . Yes yes ; I do_ _n't care about that --
Tesman . I must make a confession to you , Hedda .
When he had finished reading -- a horrid feeling came over me . Hedda .
A horrid feeling ?
Tesman . I felt jealous of Eilert for having had it in him to write such a book .
Only think , Hedda !
Hedda . Yes , yes , I am thinking !
Tesman . And then how pitiful to think that he -- with all his gifts -- should be irreclaimable , after all .
Hedda . I suppose you mean that he has more courage than the rest ?
Tesman .
No , not at=all -- I mean that he is incapable of taking his pleasure in moderation .
Hedda . And what came of it all -- in the end ?
Tesman . Well , to tell the truth , I think it might best be described as an orgie , Hedda .
Hedda . Had he vine-leaves in his hair ?
Tesman . Vine-leaves ?
No , I saw nothing of the sort .
But he made a long , rambling speech in honour of the woman who had inspired him in his work -- that was the phrase he used .
Hedda . Did he name her ?
Tesman .
No , he did_ _n't ;
but I can_ _n't help thinking he meant Mrs.=Elvsted . You may be sure he did . Hedda .
Well -- where did you part from him ?
Tesman . On the way to town .
We broke up -- the last of us at=any=rate -- all together ;
and Brack came with us to get a breath of fresh air .
And then , you see , we agreed to take Eilert home ;
for he had had far more=than was good for him .
Hedda . I daresay .
Tesman . But now comes the strange part of it , Hedda ;
or , I should rather say , the melancholy part of it .
I declare I am almost ashamed -- on Eilert's account -- to tell you --
Hedda . Oh , go on -- !
Tesman . Well , as we were getting near town , you see , I happened to drop a little behind the others .
Only for a minute or two -- fancy that !
Hedda . Yes yes yes , but -- ?
Tesman . And then , as I hurried after them -- what do you think I found by the wayside ?
Eh ?
Hedda . Oh , how should I know ! Tesman .
You must_ _n't speak of it to a soul , Hedda !
Do you hear !
Promise me , for Eilert's sake . [ Draws a parcel , wrapped in paper , from his coat pocket .
Is not that the parcel he had with him yesterday ? Tesman .
Yes , it is the whole of his precious , irreplaceable manuscript !
And he had gone and lost it , and knew nothing about it .
Only fancy , Hedda !
So deplorably -- Hedda .
But why did you not give him back the parcel at=once ?
Tesman . I did_ _n't dare to -- in the state he was then in --
Hedda . Did you not tell any of the others that you had found it ?
Tesman . Oh , far from it !
You can surely understand that , for Eilert's sake , I would_ _n't do that .
Hedda . So no=one knows that Eilert=Lovborg's manuscript is in your possession ?
Tesman . No. And no=one must know it .
Hedda . Then what did you say to him afterwards ?
Tesman . I did_ _n't talk to him again at=all ;
for when we got in among the streets , he and two or three of the others gave us the slip and disappeared .
Fancy that !
Hedda . Indeed !
They must have taken him home then .
Tesman . Yes , so it would appear .
And Brack , too , left us . Hedda .
And what have you been doing with yourself since ?
Tesman . Well , I and some of the others went home with one of the party , a jolly fellow , and took our morning coffee with him ;
or perhaps I should rather call it our night coffee -- eh ?
But now , when I have rested a little , and given Eilert , poor fellow , time to have his sleep out , I must take this back to him .
Hedda . [ Holds out her hand for the packet .
] No -- do_ _n't give it to him !
Not in such a hurry , I mean . Let me read it first . Tesman .
No , my dearest Hedda , I must_ _n't , I really must_ _n't .
Hedda . You must not ?
Tesman . No -- for you can imagine what a state of despair he will be in when he wakens and misses the manuscript .
He has no copy of it , you must know !
He told me so . Hedda . [ Looking searchingly at him .
] Can such a thing not be reproduced ? Written over again ? Tesman .
No , I do_ _n't think that would be possible .
For the inspiration , you see -- Hedda .
Yes , yes -- I suppose it depends on that -- [ Lightly .
] But , by-the-bye -- here is a letter for you .
Tesman . Fancy -- !
Hedda . [ Handing it to him .
] It came early this morning .
Tesman . It_ _s from Aunt=Julia !
What can it be ? [ He lays the packet on the other footstool , opens the letter , runs his eye through it , and jumps up .
Well , we were prepared for that .
Tesman . And that if I want to see her again , I must make haste .
I_ _ll run in to them at=once .
Hedda . [ Suppressing a smile . ] Will you run ?
Tesman . Oh , my dearest Hedda -- if you could only make up your mind to come with me !
Just think !
Hedda . [ Rises and says wearily , repelling the idea .
] No , no do_ _n't ask me .
I will not look upon sickness and death .
I loathe all sorts of ugliness .
Tesman . Well , well , then -- ! [ Bustling around .
] My hat -- ?
My overcoat -- ?
Oh , in the hall -- .
I do hope I mayn't come too late , Hedda !
Eh ?
Hedda .
Oh , if you run -- [ Berta appears at the hall door .
Berta .
Judge Brack is at the door , and wishes to know if he may come in .
Tesman . At this time !
No , I can_ _n't possibly see him . Hedda .
But I can . [ To Berta .
] Ask=Judge=Brack to come in . [ Berta goes out . Hedda .
[ Quickly , whispering .
] The parcel , Tesman !
[ She snatches it up from the stool .
Tesman . Yes , give it to me !
Hedda . No , no , I will keep it till you come back .
[ She goes to the writing-table and places it in the bookcase .
Judge Brack enters from the hall .
Hedda .
[ Nodding to him . ] You are an early bird , I must say . Brack .
Yes , do_ _n't you think so ! [ To Tesman .
] Are you on the move , too ? Tesman .
Yes , I must rush of to my aunts' .
Fancy -- the invalid one is lying at death's door , poor creature . Brack .
Dear me , is she indeed ?
Then on no account let me detain you .
At such a critical moment --
Tesman . Yes , I must really rush -- Good-bye !
Good-bye !
[ He hastens out by the hall door .
Hedda .
I assure you I have not had my clothes off , Mrs.=Hedda . Hedda .
Not you , either ?
Brack . No , as you may see .
But what has Tesman been telling you of the night's adventures ? Hedda .
Oh , some tiresome story .
Only that they went and had coffee somewhere or other .
Brack . I have heard about that coffee-party already .
Eilert=Lovborg was not with them , I fancy ?
Hedda . No , they had taken him home before that .
Brack . Tesman too ?
Hedda . No , but some of the others , he said .
Brack . [ Smiling . ] George=Tesman is really an ingenuous creature , Mrs.=Hedda .
Hedda . Yes , heaven knows he is .
Then is there something behind all this ?
Brack . Yes , perhaps there may be .
Hedda .
Well then , sit down , my dear Judge , and tell your story in comfort .
[ She seats herself to the left of the table .
Brack sits near her , at the long side of the table .
Hedda .
Now then ? Brack .
I had special reasons for keeping track of my guests -- last night .
Hedda . Of Eilert=Lovborg among the rest , perhaps ?
Brack . Frankly , yes . Hedda .
Now you make me really curious --
If it is not=quite unmentionable , tell me . Brack .
Oh no , it_ _s not at all unmentionable .
Well , they put in an appearance at a particularly animated soiree .
Hedda . Of the lively kind ?
Brack . Of the very liveliest --
Hedda . Tell me more of this , Judge Brack --
Brack . Lovborg , as=well=as the others , had been invited in=advance .
I knew all about it .
But he had declined the invitation ;
for now , as you know , he has become a new man .
Hedda . Up at the Elvsteds' , yes .
But he went after all , then ?
Brack . Well , you see , Mrs.=Hedda -- unhappily the spirit moved him at my rooms last evening --
Hedda . Yes , I hear he found inspiration . Brack .
Pretty violent inspiration .
Well , I fancy that altered his purpose ;
for we menfolk are unfortunately not always so firm in our principles as we ought=to be .
Hedda . Oh , I am sure you are an exception , Judge Brack .
But as=to Lovborg -- ?
Mademoiselle Diana's ?
Brack . It was Mademoiselle=Diana that was giving the soiree , to a select circle of her admirers and her lady friends .
Hedda . Is she a red-haired woman ?
Brack . Precisely .
Hedda .
A sort of a -- singer ? Brack .
Oh yes -- in her leisure moments .
And moreover a mighty huntress -- of men -- Mrs.=Hedda .
You have no doubt heard of her .
Eilert=Lovborg was one of her most enthusiastic protectors -- in the days of his glory .
Hedda . And how did all this end ?
Brack . Far from amicably , it appears .
After a most tender meeting , they seem to have come to blows --
Hedda . Lovborg and she ?
Brack . Yes .
He accused her or her friends of having robbed him .
He declared that his pocket-book had disappeared -- and other things as=well .
In short , he seems to have made a furious disturbance .
Hedda . And what came of it all ?
Brack . It came to a general scrimmage , in which the ladies as=well=as the gentlemen took part .
Fortunately the police at=last appeared on the scene .
Hedda . The police too ?
Brack . Yes .
I fancy it will prove a costly frolic for Eilert=Lovborg , crazy being that he is .
Hedda .
How so ? Brack .
He seems to have made a violent resistance -- to have hit one of the constables on the head and torn the coat off his back .
So they had to march him off to the police-station with the rest . Hedda . How have you learnt all this ?
Brack . From the police themselves . Hedda .
[ Gazing straight before her .
] So=that is what happened .
Then he had no vine-leaves in his hair .
Brack . Vine-leaves , Mrs.=Hedda ?
Will the matter come into court then ?
Brack . Of=course .
However , I should scarcely have troubled so much about that .
But I thought that , as a friend of the family , it was my duty to supply you and Tesman with a full account of his nocturnal exploits .
Hedda . Why so , Judge Brack ? Brack .
Why , because I have a shrewd suspicion that he intends to use you as a sort of blind .
Hedda . Oh , how can you think such a thing !
Brack . Good=heavens , Mrs.=Hedda -- we have eyes in our head .
Mark my words !
This Mrs.=Elvsted will be in no hurry to leave town again . Hedda .
Not a single home .
Henceforth , as before , every respectable house will be closed against Eilert=Lovborg .
Hedda . And so ought mine to be , you mean ?
Brack . Yes .
I confess it would be more=than painful to me if this personage were to be made free of your house .
How superfluous , how intrusive , he would be , if he were to force his way into --
Hedda .
-- into the triangle ?
Brack . Precisely . It would simply mean that I should find myself homeless . Hedda . [ Looks at him with a smile .
] So you want to be the one cock in the basket ( 12 ) -- that is your aim.
Brack . [ Nods slowly and lowers his voice .
] Yes , that is my aim. And for that I will fight -- with every weapon I can command .
Hedda . [ Her smile vanishing . ] I see you are a dangerous person -- when it comes to the point .
Brack . Do you think so ?
Hedda . I am beginning to think so .
And I am exceedingly glad to think -- that you have no sort of hold over me . Brack .
[ Laughing equivocally . ] Well well , Mrs.=Hedda -- perhaps you are right there .
If I had , who knows what I might be capable of ?
Hedda . Come come now , Judge Brack !
That sounds almost like a threat . Brack .
[ Rising . ] Oh , not at=all !
The triangle , you know , ought , if=possible , to be spontaneously constructed .
Hedda . There I agree with you .
Brack . Well , now I have said all I had to say ;
and I had better be getting back to town .
Good-bye , Mrs.=Hedda . [ He goes towards the glass door .
Hedda .
[ Rising .
] Are you going through the garden ?
Brack . Yes , it_ _s a short cut for me . Hedda .
And then it is a back way , too . Brack . Quite so .
I have no objection to back ways .
They may be piquant enough at times . Hedda .
When there is ball practice going on , you mean ?
[ Also laughing . ] Oh no , when there is only one cock in the basket --
[ They exchange laughing nods of farewell .
He goes .
She closes the door behind him .
[ Hedda , who has become quite serious , stands for a moment looking out .
Presently she goes and peeps through the curtain over the middle doorway .
Then she goes to the writing-table , takes Lovborg's packet out=of the bookcase , and is on the point of looking through its contents .
Berta is heard speaking loudly in the hall .
Hedda turns and listens .
Then she hastily locks up the packet in the drawer , and lays the key on the inkstand .
Eilert=lovborg , with his greatcoat on and his hat in his hand , tears open the hall door .
He looks somewhat confused and irritated .
Lovborg .
[ Looking towards the hall . ] and I tell you I must and will come in !
There !
[ He closes the door , turns , sees Hedda , at=once regains his self- control , and bows .
Hedda .
You mean rather an early hour to call on you .
Pray pardon me . Hedda .
How do you know that she is still here ?
Lovborg . They told me at her lodgings that she had been out all-night .
Hedda . [ Going to the oval table . ] Did you notice anything about the people of the house when they said that ?
Lovborg . [ Looks inquiringly at her .
] Notice anything about them ? Hedda . I mean , did they seem to think it odd ? Lovborg .
[ Suddenly understanding . ] Oh yes , of=course !
I am dragging her down with me !
However , I did_ _n't notice anything .
-- I suppose Tesman is not up yet .
Hedda . No -- I think not --
Lovborg .
When did he come home ?
Hedda . Very late . Lovborg . Did he tell you anything ?
Hedda . Yes , I gathered that you had had an exceedingly jolly evening at Judge Brack's .
Lovborg . Nothing more ?
Hedda . I do_ _n't think so .
However , I was so dreadfully sleepy --
Mrs . Elvsted enters through the curtains of the middle doorway .
Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Going towards him . ] Ah , Lovborg !
At=last -- !
Lovborg . Yes , at=last .
And too late !
Mrs . Elvsted . [ Looks anxiously at him .
] What is too late ? Lovborg .
Everything is too late now . It is all=over with me .
Mrs . Elvsted . Oh no , no -- do_ _n't say that !
Lovborg . You will say the same when you hear -- Mrs .
Elvsted . I will_ _n't hear anything !
Hedda . Perhaps you would prefer to talk to her alone ?
If=so , I will leave you .
Lovborg . No , stay -- you too .
I beg you to stay . Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , but I will_ _n't hear anything , I tell you .
Lovborg . It is not last night's adventures that I want to talk about . Mrs . Elvsted .
What is it then -- ?
Lovborg . I want to say that now our ways must part . Mrs .
Elvsted . Part !
Hedda . [ Involuntarily . ] I knew it !
Lovborg . You can be of no=more service to me , Thea . Mrs . Elvsted .
How can you stand there and say that !
No=more service to you !
Am I not to help you now , as before ?
Are we not to go on working together ?
Lovborg . Henceforward I shall do no work . Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Despairingly . ] Then what am I to do with my life ?
Lovborg . You must try to live your life as=if you had never know me . Mrs .
Elvsted . But you know I can_ _not do that !
Lovborg . Try if you can_ _not , Thea .
You must go home again --
Mrs . Elvsted . [ In vehement protest .
] Never in this world ! Where you are , there will I be also !
I will not let myself be driven away like this !
I will remain here !
I will be with you when the book appears .
Hedda . [ Half aloud , in suspense . ] Ah yes -- the book !
Lovborg . [ Looks at her .
] My book and Thea's ;
for that is what it is . Mrs . Elvsted . Yes , I feel that it is .
And that is why I have a right to be with you when it appears !
I will see with my own eyes how respect and honour pour in upon you afresh .
And the happiness -- the happiness -- oh , I must share it with you !
Lovborg . Thea -- our book will never appear . Hedda .
Ah ! Mrs .
Elvsted . Never appear !
Lovborg .
Can never appear .
Mrs . Elvsted .
[ In agonised foreboding .
] Lovborg -- what have you done with the manuscript ? Hedda .
[ Looks anxiously at him . ] Yes , the manuscript -- ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Where is it ?
[ Shrieks . ] Oh no , no -- !
Hedda . [ Involuntarily . ] But that_ _s not --
Lovborg .
[ Looks at her .
] Not true , you think ?
Hedda . [ Collecting herself .
] Oh well , of=course -- since you say so . But it sounded so improbable --
Lovborg .
Elvsted . [ Wringing her hands .
] Oh=God -- oh God , Hedda -- torn his own work to pieces !
Lovborg . I have torn my own life to pieces .
So why should I not tear my life-work too -- ?
Mrs . Elvsted .
And you did this last night ?
Lovborg .
Yes , I tell you !
Tore it into a thousand pieces -- and scattered them on the fiord -- far-out .
There there is cool sea-water at=any=rate -- let them drift upon it -- drift with the current and the wind . And then presently they will sink -- deeper and deeper -- as I shall , Thea .
Mrs . Elvsted .
Do you know , Lovborg , that what you have done with the book -- I shall think of it to my dying day as=though you had killed a little child .
Lovborg . Yes , you are right .
It is a sort of child-murder . Mrs .
Elvsted . How could you , then -- !
Did not the child belong to me too ? Hedda .
[ Almost inaudibly . ] Ah , the child -- Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Breathing heavily .
] It is all=over then . Well well , now I will go , Hedda .
Hedda . But you are not going away from town ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh , I do_ _n't know what I shall do .
I see nothing but darkness before me . [ She goes out by the hall door .
Hedda .
[ Stands waiting for a moment . ] So you are not going to see her home , Mr. Lovborg ?
Lovborg . I ?
Through the streets ?
Would you have people see her walking with me ?
Hedda . Of=course I do_ _n't know what else may have happened last night .
But is it so utterly irretrievable ?
Lovborg .
It will not end with last night -- I know that perfectly well .
And the thing is that now I have no taste for that sort of life either .
I will_ _n't begin it anew .
She has broken my courage and my power of braving life out .
Hedda . [ Looking straight before her . ] So=that pretty little fool has had her fingers in a man's destiny . [ Looks at him .
] But all=the=same , how could you treat her so heartlessly . Lovborg .
Oh , do_ _n't say that I was heartless !
Hedda . To go and destroy what has filled her whole soul for months and years !
You do not call that heartless !
Lovborg . To you I can tell the truth , Hedda .
Hedda . The truth ?
Lovborg . First promise me -- give me your word -- that what I now confide in you Thea shall never know .
Hedda . I give you my word .
Lovborg . Good .
About the manuscript ?
Lovborg . Yes .
I have not torn it to pieces -- nor thrown it into the fiord .
Hedda . No , no -- .
But -- where is it then ?
Lovborg . I have destroyed it none=the=less -- utterly destroyed it , Hedda !
Hedda .
I do_ _n't understand . Lovborg .
Thea said that what I had done seemed to her like a child-murder .
Hedda . Yes , so she said .
Lovborg . But to kill his child -- that is not the worst thing a father can do to it .
Hedda .
Not the worst ? Lovborg .
Suppose now , Hedda , that a man -- in the small hours of the morning -- came home to his child's mother after a night of riot and debauchery , and said : " Listen -- I have been here=and=there -- in this place and in that .
And I have taken our child with -- to this place and to that .
And I have lost the child -- utterly lost it .
The devil knows into what hands it may have fallen -- who may have had their clutches on it .
" Hedda .
Well -- but when all is said and done , you know -- this was only a book --
Lovborg . Thea's pure soul was in that book .
Hedda . Yes , so I understand .
What path do you mean to take then ?
Lovborg . None .
I will only try to make an end of it all -- the sooner the better . Hedda . [ A step nearer him .
] Eilert=Lovborg -- listen to me .
-- Will you not try to -- to do it beautifully ?
Lovborg . Beautifully ? [ Smiling .
] With vine-leaves in my hair , as you used to dream in the old days -- ?
Hedda .
No , no. I have lost my faith in the vine-leaves .
But beautifully nevertheless !
For once in a way !
-- Good-bye !
You must go now -- and do not come here any=more .
Lovborg .
Good-bye , Mrs.=Tesman .
And give George=Tesman my love .
[ He is on the point of going .
Hedda . No , wait !
I must give you a memento to take with you .
[ She goes to the writing-table and opens the drawer and the pistol-case ;
then returns to Lovborg with one of the pistols .
Lovborg .
[ Looks at her . ] This ?
Is this the memento ?
Hedda . [ Nodding slowly .
] Do you recognise it ? It was aimed at you once .
Lovborg . You should have used it then .
Hedda .
Take it -- and do you use it now .
Lovborg . [ Puts the pistol in his breast pocket . ] Thanks !
Hedda . And beautifully , Eilert=Lovborg .
Promise me that !
Lovborg .
Good-bye , Hedda=Gabler . [ He goes out by the hall door .
[ Hedda listens for a moment at the door .
Then she goes up=to the writing-table , takes out the packet of manuscript , peeps under the cover , draws a=few of the sheets half out , and looks at them .
Next she goes over and seats herself in the arm-chair beside the stove , with the packet in her lap .
Presently she opens the stove door , and then the packet .
Hedda .
[ Throws one of the quires into the fire and whispers to herself .
] Now=I am burning your child , Thea !
-- Burning it , curly-locks ! [ Throwing one or two more quires into the stove .
] Your child and Eilert=Lovborg's . [ Throws the rest in . ] I am burning -- I am burning your child .
Act Fourth .
The same rooms at the Tesmans' .
It is evening .
The drawing- room is in darkness .
The back room is light by the hanging lamp over the table .
The curtains over the glass door are drawn close .
Hedda , dressed in black , walks to=and=fro in the dark room .
Then she goes into the back room and disappears for a moment to the left .
She is heard to strike a=few chords on the piano .
Berta enters from the right , through the inner room , with a lighted lamp , which she places on the table in=front of the corner settee in the drawing-room .
Her eyes are red with weeping , and she has black ribbons in her cap .
She goes quietly and circumspectly out to the right .
Hedda goes up to the glass door , lifts the curtain a little aside , and looks out into the darkness .
Shortly afterwards , Miss=tesman , in mourning , with a bonnet and veil on , comes in from the hall .
Hedda goes towards her and holds out her hand .
Miss=tesman .
Yes , Hedda , here I am , in mourning and forlorn ;
for now my poor sister has at=last found peace . Hedda .
I have heard the news already , as you see .
Tesman sent me a card .
Miss=tesman . Yes , he promised me he would .
But nevertheless I thought that to Hedda -- here in the house of life -- I ought myself to bring the tidings of death .
Hedda . That was very kind of you .
Miss=tesman . Ah , Rina ought not to have left us just now .
This is not the time for Hedda's house to be a house of mourning .
Hedda . [ Changing the subject .
] She died quite peacefully , did she not , Miss Tesman ?
Miss=tesman . Oh , her end was so calm , so beautiful .
And then she had the unspeakable happiness of seeing George once=more -- and bidding him good-bye .
-- Has he not come home yet ?
Hedda .
No. He wrote that he might be detained .
But will_ _n't you sit down ?
Miss=tesman . No thank you , my dear , dear Hedda .
I should like to , but I have so much to do .
I must prepare my dear one for her rest as=well=as I can .
She shall go to her grave looking her best .
Hedda . Can I not help you in any way ?
Miss=tesman . Oh , you must not think of it !
Hedda=Tesman must have no hand in such mournful work .
Nor let her thought dwell on it either -- not at this time . Hedda .
One is not always mistress of one's thoughts --
Miss=tesman . [ Continuing .
] Ah yes , it is the way of the world .
At home we shall be sewing a shroud ;
and here there will soon be sewing too , I suppose -- but of another sort , thank God !
George=tesman enters by the hall door .
Hedda .
Ah , you have come at=last !
Tesman . You here , Aunt=Julia ?
With=Hedda ?
Fancy that !
Miss=tesman . I was just going , my dear boy .
Well , have you done all you promised ? Tesman .
No ; I_ _m really afraid I have forgotten half of it .
I must come to you again to-morrow .
To-day my brain is all in a whirl .
I can_ _n't keep my thoughts together .
Miss=tesman . Why , my dear George , you must_ _n't take it in this way .
Tesman .
Must_ _n't -- ? How do you mean ?
Miss=tesman . Even in your sorrow you must rejoice , as I do -- rejoice that she is at rest .
Tesman .
Oh yes , yes -- you are thinking of Aunt=Rina .
Hedda .
You will feel lonely now , Miss=Tesman .
Miss=tesman . Just at=first , yes .
But that will not last very long , I hope .
I daresay I shall soon find an occupant for Rina's little room . Tesman .
Indeed ?
Who do you think will take it ?
Eh ?
Miss=tesman . Oh , there_ _s always some poor invalid or other in want of nursing , unfortunately .
Hedda . Would you really take such a burden upon you again ?
Miss=tesman . A burden !
Heaven forgive you , child -- it has been no burden to me . Hedda .
But suppose you had a total stranger on your hands --
Miss=tesman . Oh , one soon makes friends with sick folk ;
and it_ _s such an absolute necessity for me to have some one to live for .
Oh , do_ _n't trouble about anything here .
Tesman . Yes , just fancy what a nice time we three might have together , if -- ?
Hedda . If -- ?
Tesman . [ Uneasily . ] Oh nothing .
It will all come right .
Let us hope so -- eh ?
Miss=tesman .
Well well , I daresay you two want to talk to each=other . [ Smiling .
] And perhaps Hedda may have something to tell you too , George .
Good-bye !
I must go home to Rina . [ Turning at the door .
] How strange it is to think that now Rina is with me and with my poor brother as=well !
Tesman . Yes , fancy that , Aunt=Julia !
Eh ?
[ Miss Tesman goes out by the hall door .
Hedda .
[ Follows Tesman coldly and searchingly with her eyes . ] I almost believe your Aunt=Rina's death affects you more=than it does your Aunt=Julia .
Tesman . Oh , it_ _s not that alone .
It_ _s Eilert=I am so terribly uneasy about . Hedda .
[ Quickly . ] Is there anything new about him ?
Tesman . I looked in at his rooms this afternoon , intending to tell him the manuscript was in safe keeping .
Hedda .
Well , did you find him ?
Tesman .
No. He was_ _n't at-home .
Yes , directly after you had gone .
Tesman . And he said that he had torn his manuscript to pieces -- eh ?
Hedda .
Yes , so he declared . Tesman .
Why , good=heavens , he must have been completely out=of his mind !
And I suppose you thought it best not to give it back to him , Hedda ?
Hedda . No , he did not get it .
Tesman . But of=course you told him that we had it ?
Hedda .
No. [ Quickly . ] Did you tell Mrs.=Elvsted ? Tesman . No ;
I thought I had better not .
But you ought=to have told him .
Fancy , if , in desperation , he should go and do himself some injury !
Let me have the manuscript , Hedda !
I will take it to him at=once .
Where is it ? Hedda .
[ Cold and immovable , leaning on the arm-chair . ] I have not got it .
Tesman . Have not got it ?
What in the world do you mean ? Hedda .
I have burnt it -- every line of it .
Tesman . [ With a violent movement of terror .
] Burnt ! Burnt=Eilert's manuscript ! Hedda .
Do_ _n't scream so .
The servant might hear you .
Tesman . Burnt !
Why , good God -- !
No , no , no ! It_ _s impossible !
Hedda . It is so , nevertheless .
Tesman . Do you know what you have done , Hedda ?
It_ _s unlawful appropriation of lost property .
Fancy that !
Just ask Judge Brack , and he_ _ll tell you what it is .
Hedda . I advise you not to speak of it -- either to Judge Brack or to anyone else .
Tesman . But how could you do anything so unheard-of ?
What put it into your head ?
What possessed you ?
Answer me that -- eh ?
Hedda .
[ Suppressing an almost imperceptible smile . ] I did it for your sake , George . Tesman .
For my sake !
Hedda . This morning , when you told me about what he had read to you --
Tesman . Yes yes -- what then ?
Hedda . You acknowledged that you envied him his work . Tesman .
Oh , of=course I did_ _n't mean that literally .
Hedda .
No=matter -- I could not bear the idea that any one should throw you into the shade .
Tesman . [ In an outburst of mingled doubt and joy . ] Hedda ! Oh , is this true ?
But -- but -- I never knew you show your love like that before .
Fancy that !
Hedda . Well , I may as=well tell you that -- just at this time -- [ Impatiently breaking off . ] No , no ; you can ask Aunt=Julia .
She well tell you , fast enough . Tesman .
Oh , I almost think I understand you , Hedda ! [ Clasps his hands together .
] Great heavens ! do you really mean it !
Eh ?
Hedda . Do_ _n't shout so .
The servant might hear . Tesman .
[ Laughing in irrepressible glee . ] The servant !
Why , how absurd you are , Hedda .
It_ _s only my old Berta !
Why , I_ _ll tell Berta myself .
Hedda . [ Clenching her hands together in desperation . ] Oh , it is killing me , -- it is killing me , all this !
Tesman . What is , Hedda ?
Eh ?
Hedda . [ Coldly , controlling herself . ] All this -- absurdity -- George .
Tesman . Absurdity !
Do you see anything absurd in my being overjoyed at the news !
But after all -- perhaps I had better not say anything to Berta .
Hedda . Oh -- why not that too ?
Tesman . No , no , not=yet !
But I must certainly tell Aunt=Julia .
And then that you have begun to call me George too !
Fancy that !
Oh , Aunt=Julia will be so happy -- so happy ! Hedda .
When she hears that I have burnt Eilert=Lovborg's manuscript -- for your sake ?
Tesman .
No , by-the-bye -- that affair of the manuscript -- of=course nobody must know about that .
But that you love me so much , ( 13 ) Hedda -- Aunt Julia must really share my joy in that !
I wonder , now , whether this sort of thing is usual in young wives ?
Eh ?
Hedda . I think you had better ask Aunt=Julia that question too .
Tesman . I will indeed , some time or other . [ Looks uneasy and downcast again .
] And yet the manuscript -- the manuscript ! Good=God !
it is terrible to think what will become of poor Eilert now .
Mrs . Elvsted , dressed as=in the first Act , with hat and cloak , enters by the hall door .
Mrs .
What is the matter with you , Thea ?
Tesman . Something about Eilert=Lovborg again -- eh ? Mrs . Elvsted .
Yes !
I am dreadfully afraid some misfortune has happened to him . Hedda .
[ Seized her arm. ] Ah , -- do you think so ? Tesman .
Elvsted . I heard them talking of him at my boarding-house -- just as I came in .
Oh , the most incredible rumours are afloat about him to-day .
Tesman . Yes , fancy , so I heard too !
And I can bear witness that he went straight home to bed last night .
Fancy that !
Hedda . Well , what did they say at the boarding-house ? Mrs . Elvsted .
Oh , I could_ _n't make out anything clearly .
Either they knew nothing definite , or=else -- .
They stopped talking when the saw me ;
and I did not dare to ask . Tesman .
No , no ; I am sure it was of him they were talking .
And I heard something about the hospital or -- Tesman .
The hospital ? Hedda .
No -- surely that can_ _not be ! Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh , I was in such mortal terror !
I went to his lodgings and asked for him there . Hedda .
You could make up your mind to that , Thea ! Mrs .
Elvsted . What else could I do ?
I really could bear the suspense no=longer . Tesman .
But you did_ _n't find him either -- eh ?
Mrs .
Elvsted .
No. And the people knew nothing about him .
He had_ _n't been home since yesterday afternoon , they said .
Tesman . Yesterday !
Fancy , how could they say that ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh , I am sure something terrible must have happened to him .
No , no -- do_ _n't you mix yourself up in this affair .
Judge Brack , with his hat in his hand , enters by the hall door , which Berta opens , and closes behind him .
He looks grave and bows in silence .
Tesman .
Oh , is that you , my dear Judge ?
Eh ?
Brack . Yes . It was imperative I should see you this evening .
Tesman . I can see you have heard the news about Aunt=Rina ? Brack .
Yes , that among other things .
Tesman . Is_ _n't it sad -- eh ?
Brack .
Well , my dear Tesman , that depends on how you look at it .
Tesman . [ Looks doubtfully at him .
] Has anything=else happened ?
Brack . Yes . Hedda . [ In suspense . ] Anything sad , Judge Brack ? Brack .
That , too , depends on how you look at it , Mrs.=Tesman . Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Unable to restrain her anxiety . ] Oh !
it is something about Eilert Lovborg ! Brack . [ With a glance at her .
] What makes you think that , Madam ? Perhaps you have already heard something -- ?
Mrs . Elvsted . [ In confusion .
] No , nothing at=all , but --
Tesman . Oh , for heaven's sake , tell us !
Brack . [ Shrugging his shoulders . ] Well , I regret to say Eilert=Lovborg has been taken to the hospital .
He is lying at the point of death . Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Shrieks . ] Oh=God !
oh God -- ! Tesman . To the hospital !
And at the point of death !
Hedda . [ Involuntarily . ] So soon then -- Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Wailing . ] And we parted in anger , Hedda ! Hedda .
[ Whispers . ] Thea -- Thea -- be careful ! Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Not heeding her . ] I must go to him !
I must see him alive !
Brack . It is useless , Madam .
No=one will be admitted . Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh , at=least tell me what has happened to him ?
What is it ?
Tesman . You do_ _n't mean to say that he has himself -- Eh ?
Hedda .
Yes , I am sure he has . Brack .
[ Keeping his eyes fixed upon her .
] Unfortunately you have guessed quite correctly , Mrs.=Tesman . Mrs . Elvsted .
Oh , how horrible ! Tesman .
Himself , then !
Fancy that !
Hedda . Shot himself !
Brack . Rightly guessed again , Mrs.=Tesman .
Mrs . Elvsted . [ With an effort at self-control .
] When did it happen , Mr.=Brack ?
Brack . This afternoon -- between=three=and=four .
Tesman . But , good Lord , where did he do it ?
Eh ?
Brack . [ With some hesitation .
] Where ? Well -- I suppose at his lodgings . Mrs .
Elvsted . No , that can_ _not be ;
for I was there between=six=and=seven . Brack .
Well then , somewhere else .
I do_ _n't know exactly .
I only know that he was found -- .
He had shot himself -- in the breast . Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh , how terrible !
That he should die like that !
Hedda . [ To Brack . ] Was it in the breast ?
Brack . Yes -- as I told you .
Hedda . Not in the temple ?
Brack . In the breast , Mrs.=Tesman .
Hedda . Well , well -- the breast is a good place , too . Brack .
How do you mean , Mrs.=Tesman ?
Hedda . [ Evasively . ] Oh , nothing -- nothing .
Tesman . And the wound is dangerous , you say -- eh ?
Brack .
Absolutely mortal . The end has probably come by this time .
Mrs . Elvsted .
Yes , yes , I feel it .
The end !
The end !
Oh , Hedda -- !
Tesman . But tell me , how have you learnt all this ? Brack .
[ Curtly . ] Through one of the police .
A man I had some business with .
Hedda . [ In a clear voice . ] At=last a deed worth doing ! Tesman . [ Terrified .
] Good=heavens , Hedda !
what are you saying ? Hedda . I say there is beauty in this .
Brack . H'm , Mrs.=Tesman --
Mrs .
Elvsted .
Oh , Hedda , how can you talk of beauty in such an act ! Hedda .
Eilert=Lovborg has himself made up his account with life .
He has had the courage to do -- the one right thing . Mrs . Elvsted .
No , you must never think that was how it happened !
It must have been in delirium that he did it .
Tesman . In despair ! Hedda .
That he did not .
I am certain of that . Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , yes !
In delirium !
Just as when he tore up our manuscript .
Brack . [ Starting .
] The manuscript ?
Has he torn that up ? Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , last night . Tesman .
[ Whispers softly . ] Oh , Hedda , we shall never get over this . Brack .
H'm , very extraordinary .
Tesman . [ Moving about the room . ] To think of Eilert going out=of the world in this way !
And not leaving behind him the book that would have immortalised his name -- Mrs . Elvsted .
Oh , if only it could be put=together again !
Tesman . Yes , if it only could !
I do_ _n't know what I would not give -- Mrs .
Elvsted . Perhaps it can , Mr.=Tesman . Tesman . What do you mean ?
Mrs . Elvsted .
[ Searches in the pocket of her dress . ] Look here .
I have kept all the loose notes he used to dictate from .
Hedda . [ A step forward . ] Ah -- !
Tesman . You have kept them , Mrs.=Elvsted !
Eh ?
Mrs . Elvsted . Yes , I have them here .
I put them in my pocket when I left home .
Here they still are --
Tesman . Oh , do let me see them !
Mrs . Elvsted . [ Hands him a bundle of papers .
] But they are in such disorder -- all mixed up .
Tesman . Fancy , if we could make something out=of them , after all !
Perhaps if we two put our heads together -- Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh yes , at=least let us try --
Tesman . We will manage it !
We must !
I will dedicate my life to this task .
Hedda . You , George ?
Your life ?
Tesman . Yes , or rather all=the=time I can spare .
My own collections must wait in the meantime .
Hedda -- you understand , eh ?
I owe this to Eilert's memory . Hedda .
Perhaps . Tesman .
And so , my dear Mrs.=Elvsted , we will give our whole minds to it .
There is no use in brooding over what can_ _n't be undone -- eh ?
We must try to control our grief as much as possible , and -- Mrs .
Elvsted . Yes , yes , Mr.=Tesman , I will do the best I can . Tesman .
Well then , come here .
I can_ _n't rest until we have looked through the notes .
Where shall we sit ?
Here ?
No , in=there , in the back room .
Excuse me , my dear Judge .
Come with me , Mrs.=Elvsted . Mrs .
Elvsted . Oh , if only it were possible !
[ Tesman and Mrs . Elvsted go into the back room .
She takes off her hat and cloak .
They both sit at the table under the hanging lamp , and are soon deep in an eager examination of the papers .
Hedda crosses to the stove and sits in the arm- chair .
Presently Brack goes up=to her .
Hedda .
[ In a low voice . ] Oh , what a sense of freedom it gives one , this act of Eilert=Lovborg's .
Brack . Freedom , Mrs.=Hedda ?
Well , of=course , it is a release for him --
Hedda . I mean for me .
It gives me a sense of freedom to know that a deed of deliberate courage is still possible in this world , -- a deed of spontaneous beauty .
Brack . [ Smiling .
] H'm -- my dear Mrs.=Hedda -- Hedda .
Oh , I know what you are going to say .
For you are a=kind=of specialist too , like -- you know !
Brack . [ Looking hard at her . ] Eilert=Lovborg was more to you than perhaps you are willing to admit to yourself .
Am I wrong ? Hedda .
I do_ _n't answer such questions .
I only know that Eilert=Lovborg has had the courage to live his life after his own fashion .
And then -- the last great act , with its beauty !
Ah !
that he should have the will and the strength to turn away from the banquet of life -- so early .
Illusion ? Brack .
Which could not have lasted long in any case .
Hedda . What do you mean ?
Brack . Eilert=Lovborg did not shoot himself -- voluntarily .
Hedda .
Not voluntarily ?
Brack . No. The thing did not happen exactly as I told it . Hedda .
[ In suspense . ] Have you concealed something ?
What is it ?
Brack . For poor Mrs.=Elvsted's sake I idealised the facts a little . Hedda .
What are the facts ?
Brack . First , that he is already dead .
Hedda . At the hospital ?
Brack .
Yes -- without regaining consciousness .
Hedda . What more have you concealed ?
Brack . This -- the event did not happen at his lodgings .
Hedda . Oh , that can make no difference . Brack .
Perhaps it may .
For I must tell you -- Eilert=Lovborg was found shot in -- in Mademoiselle=Diana's boudoir .
Hedda . [ Makes a motion as=if to rise , but sinks back again .
] That is impossible , Judge Brack ! He can_ _not have been there again to-day .
Brack . He was there this afternoon .
He went there , he said , to demand the return of something which they had taken from him .
Talked wildly about a lost child -- Hedda .
Ah -- so=that is why --
Brack . I thought probably he meant his manuscript ;
but now I hear he destroyed that himself .
So I suppose it must have been his pocket-book .
Hedda . Yes , no doubt .
And there -- there he was found ?
Brack . Yes , there .
With a pistol in his breast-pocket , discharged .
The ball had lodged in a vital part .
Hedda . In the breast -- yes ?
Brack . No -- in the bowels .
Hedda . [ Looks up at him with an expression of loathing .
] That too ! Oh , what curse is it that makes everything I touch turn ludicrous and mean ?
Brack . There is one point more , Mrs.=Hedda -- another disagreeable feature in the affair .
Hedda . And what is that ?
Brack . The pistol he carried -- Hedda .
[ Breathless . ] Well ?
What of it ?
Brack . He must have stolen it .
Hedda . [ Leaps up .
] Stolen it !
That is not true !
He did not steal it ! Brack .
No other explanation is possible . He must have stolen it -- .
Hush !
Tesman and Mrs . Elvsted have risen from the table in the back- room , and come into the drawing-room .
Tesman .
[ With the papers in both his hands . ] Hedda , dear , it is almost impossible to see under that lamp .
Think of that !
Hedda . Yes , I am thinking .
Tesman . Would you mind our sitting at you writing-table -- eh ?
Hedda .
If you like . [ Quickly .
] No , wait !
Let me clear it first !
Tesman . Oh , you needn't trouble , Hedda .
There is plenty=of room .
Hedda . No no , let me clear it , I say !
I will take these things in and put them on the piano .
There !
[ She has drawn-out an object , covered with sheet music , from under the bookcase , places several=other pieces of music upon it , and carries the whole into the inner room , to the left .
Tesman lays the scraps of paper on the writing-table , and moves the lamp there from the corner table .
He and Mrs.=Elvsted sit down and proceed with their work .
Hedda returns .
Hedda .
Elvsted . [ Looks dispiritedly up at her . ] Oh , it will be terribly hard to put in order .
Tesman . We must manage it .
I am determined .
And arranging other people's papers is just the work for me .
[ Hedda goes over to the stove , and seats herself on one of the footstools .
Brack stands over her , leaning on the arm-chair .
Hedda .
[ Whispers . ] What did you say about the pistol ?
Brack . [ Softly . ] That he must have stolen it .
Hedda . Why stolen it ? Brack .
Because every other explanation ought=to be impossible , Mrs.=Hedda . Hedda .
Indeed ?
Brack . [ Glances at her . ] Of=course Eilert=Lovborg was here this morning .
Was he not ?
Hedda . Yes .
Brack . Were you alone with him ?
Hedda . Part of the time .
Brack .
Try to recollect .
Were you not out=of the room a moment ?
Hedda . Yes , perhaps just a moment -- out in the hall . Brack .
And where was you pistol-case during that time ? Hedda .
I had it locked up in --
Brack . Well , Mrs.=Hedda ?
Hedda . The case stood there on the writing-table .
Brack .
Well , you need not .
I saw the pistol found in Lovborg's pocket , and I knew it at=once as the one I had seen yesterday -- and before , too .
Hedda . Have you it with you ?
Brack . No ;
the police have it . Hedda .
What will the police do with it ?
Brack . Search till they find the owner .
Hedda . Do you think they will succeed ?
Brack . [ Bends over her and whispers .
] No , Hedda=Gabler -- not so long as I say nothing . Hedda . [ Looks frightened at him .
] And if you do not say nothing , -- what then ? Brack .
[ Shrugs his shoulders . ] There is always the possibility that the pistol was stolen .
Hedda . [ Firmly .
] Death rather=than that . Brack . [ Smiling .
] People say such things -- but they do_ _n't do them . Hedda .
[ Without replying . ] And supposing the pistol was not stolen , and the owner is discovered ?
What then ? Brack .
Well , Hedda -- then comes the scandal !
Hedda . The scandal !
Brack . Yes , the scandal -- of which you are so mortally afraid .
You will , of course , be brought before the court -- both you and Mademoiselle=Diana .
She will have to explain how the thing happened -- whether it was an accidental shot or murder .
Did the pistol go off as he was trying to take it out=of his pocket , to threaten her with ?
Or did she tear the pistol out=of his hand , shoot him , and push it back into his pocket ?
That would be quite like her ;
for she is an able-bodied young person , this same Mademoiselle=Diana . Hedda .
But _I_ have nothing to do with all this repulsive business .
Brack .
No. But you will have to answer the question : Why did you give Eilert the pistol ?
And what conclusions will people draw from the fact that you did give it to him ?
Hedda . [ Lets her head sink .
] That is true . I did not think of that .
Brack . Well , fortunately , there is no danger , so long as I say nothing .
Hedda . [ Looks up at him . ] So=I am in your power , Judge Brack .
You have me at your beck and call , from this time forward . Brack . [ Whispers softly .
I am in your power none=the=less .
Subject to your will and your demands .
A slave , a slave then ! [ Rises impetuously .
] No , I can_ _not endure the thought of that !
Never !
Brack . [ Looks half-mockingly at her .
] People generally get used to the inevitable . Hedda .
Suppressing an involuntary smile , she imitates Tesman's intonations . ] Well ? Are you getting on , George ?
Eh ?
Tesman . Heaven knows , dear .
In any case it will be the work of months .
Hedda . [ As before .
] Fancy that ! [ Passes her hands softly through Mrs.=Elvsted's hair . ] Does_ _n't it seem strange to you , Thea ?
Ah , if I could only inspire your husband in the same way !
Hedda . Oh , that will come too -- in time .
Tesman . Yes , do you know , Hedda -- I really think I begin to feel something of the sort .
But will_ _n't you go and sit with Brack again ?
Hedda . Is there nothing I can do to help you two ? Tesman .
No , nothing in the world . [ Turning his head .
[ With a glance at Hedda . ] With the very greatest of pleasure .
Hedda . Thanks .
But I am tired this evening .
I will go in and lie down a little on the sofa .
Tesman . Yes , do dear -- eh ?
[ Hedda goes into the back room and draws the curtains .
A short pause .
Suddenly she is heard playing a wild dance on the piano .
Mrs .
Elvsted . [ Starts from her chair . ] Oh -- what is that ?
Tesman . [ Runs to the doorway . ] Why , my dearest Hedda -- do_ _n't play dance-music to-night !
Just think of Aunt=Rina !
And=of=Eilert too !
Hedda . [ Puts her head out between the curtains . ] And=of=Aunt=Julia .
And of all the rest of them .
-- After this , I will be quiet . [ Closes the curtains again . ]
Tesman .
[ At the writing-table .
] It_ _s not good for her to see us at this distressing work .
I_ _ll tell you what , Mrs.=Elvsted , -- you shall take the empty room at Aunt=Julia's , and then I will come over in the evenings , and we can sit and work there -- eh ?
Hedda .
[ In the inner room .
] I hear what you are saying , Tesman .
But how am _I_ to get through the evenings out here ? Tesman .
[ In the arm-chair , calls out gaily . ] Every blessed evening , with all the pleasure in life , Mrs.=Tesman !
We shall get on capitally together , we two ! Hedda .
[ Speaking loud and clear . ] Yes , do_ _n't you flatter yourself we will , Judge Brack ?
Now that you are the one cock in the basket --
[ A shot is heard within .
Tesman , Mrs . Elvsted , and Brack leap to their feet .
Tesman .
Oh , now she is playing with those pistols again .
[ He throws back the curtains and runs in , followed by Mrs .
Elvsted .
Hedda lies stretched on the sofa , lifeless .
Confusion and cries .
Berta enters in alarm from the right .
Tesman .
[ Shrieks to Brack . ] Shot herself !
Shot herself in the temple !
Fancy that !
Brack . [ Half-fainting in the arm-chair . ] Good=God ! -- people do_ _n't do such things .
