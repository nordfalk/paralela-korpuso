Persons .
JOHN=GABRIEL=BORKMAN , formerly Managing=Director of a Bank .
Mrs . Gunhild=borkman , his wife .
Erhart=borkman , their son , a student .
MISS=ELLA=RENTHEIM , Mrs.=Borkman's twin sister .
Mrs . Fanny Wilton .
Vilhelm=foldal , subordinate clerk in a Government office .
Frida=foldal , his daughter .
Mrs . Borkman's Maid .
The action passes one winter evening , at the Manorhouse of the Rentheim family , in the neighbourhood of Christiania .
Act First
Mrs . BORKMAN's drawing-room , furnished with old-fashioned , faded splendour .
At the back , an open sliding-door leads into a garden-room , with windows and a glass door .
Through it a view over the garden ; twilight with driving snow .
On the right , a door leading from the hall .
Further forward , a large old-fashioned iron stove , with the fire lighted .
On the left , towards the back , a single smaller door .
In=front , on the same side , a window , covered with thick curtains .
Between the window and the door a horsehair sofa , with a table in front of it covered with a cloth .
On the table , a lighted lamp with a shade .
Beside the stove a high-backed armchair .
Mrs . Gunhild=borkman sits on the sofa , crocheting .
She is an elderly lady , of cold , distinguished appearance , with stiff carriage and immobile features .
Her abundant hair is very grey .
Delicate transparent hands .
Dressed in a gown of heavy dark silk , which has originally been handsome , but is now somewhat worn and shabby .
A woollen shawl over her shoulders .
She sits for a time erect and immovable at her crochet .
Then the bells of a passing sledge are heard .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Listens ;
her eyes sparkle with gladness and she involuntarily whispers ] .
Erhart !
At=last ! [ She rises and draws the curtain a little aside to look out .
Appears disappointed , and sits down to her work again , on the sofa .
Presently The=maid enters from the hall with a visiting card on a small tray .
Mrs .
Borkman . [ Quickly . ] Has=Mr.=Erhart come after all ?
The Maid . No , ma'am .
But there_ _s a lady ---- Mrs .
Borkman . [ Laying aside her crochet . ] Oh , Mrs.=Wilton , I suppose ---- The Maid . [ Approaching .
] No , it_ _s a strange lady ---- Mrs .
Borkman . [ Taking the card . ] Let me see ---- [ Reads it ;
rises hastily and looks intently at the girl .
] Are you sure this is for me ? The Maid .
Yes , I understand it was for you , ma'am . Mrs .
Borkman . Did she say she wanted to see Mrs.=Borkman ?
The Maid . Yes , she did . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Shortly , resolutely .
] Good .
Then say I am at-home .
MISS=ELLA=RENTHEIM enters .
She resembles her sister ;
but her face has rather a suffering than a hard expression .
It still shows signs of great beauty , combined with strong character .
She has a great deal of hair , which is drawn back from the forehead in natural ripples , and is snow-white .
[ The two sisters stand silent for a time , and look searchingly at each=other .
Borkman . [ Standing erect and immovable between the sofa and the table , resting her finger-tips upon the cloth .
] Have you not made a mistake ?
The bailiff lives in the side wing , you know .
Ella=rentheim . It is not the bailiff I want to see to-day . Mrs .
Borkman . Is it me you want , then ?
Ella=rentheim .
Yes . I have a=few words to say to you .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Coming forward into the middle of the room . ] Well -- then sit down .
Ella=rentheim . Thank you .
I can quite well stand for the present . Mrs .
Borkman . Just as you please .
But at=least loosen your cloak .
Ella=rentheim . [ Unbuttoning her cloak . ] Yes , it is very warm here . Mrs .
Borkman . I am always cold .
Borkman . [ Coldly . ] Since last we spoke to each=other at=any=rate .
Ella=rentheim . True , since we spoke to each=other .
Borkman . Once=or=twice , I have .
Ella=rentheim .
I have caught one or two glimpses of you , too -- there , at the window . Mrs .
Borkman . You must have seen me through the curtains then .
You have good eyes . [ Harshly and cuttingly .
] But the last time we spoke to each other -- it was here in this room ---- Ella=rentheim . [ Trying to stop her .
] Yes , yes ; I know , Gunhild ! Mrs . Borkman .
-- the week before he -- before he was let out .
Ella=rentheim . [ Moving towards the back . ] O , do_ _n't speak about that .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Firmly , but in a low voice . ] It was the week before he -- was set at liberty .
Ella=rentheim . [ Coming down . ] Oh yes , yes , yes !
I shall never forget that time !
But it is too terrible to think of !
Only to recall it for the moment -- oh !
Mrs .
Borkman . [ Gloomily .
] And yet one's thoughts can never get away from it . [ Vehemently ;
clenching her hands together . ] No , I can_ _n't understand how such a thing -- how anything so horrible can come upon one single family !
And then -- that it should be our family !
So old a family as ours !
Think of its choosing us out !
Borkman . Oh yes ;
but those others do_ _n't trouble me very much .
For in their case it was only a matter of a=little money -- or some papers .
But=for us ---- !
For me !
And then for Erhart !
My little boy -- as he then was ! [ In rising excitement .
] The shame that fell upon us two innocent ones !
The dishonour !
The hateful , terrible dishonour !
And then the utter ruin too !
Ella=rentheim . [ Cautiously . ] Tell me , Gunhild , how does he bear it ? Mrs .
Borkman . Erhart , do you mean ?
Ella=rentheim . No -- he himself .
How does he bear it ?
Mrs . Borkman . [ Scornfully . ] Do you think I ever ask about that ?
Ella=rentheim . Ask ?
Surely you do not require to ask ---- Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looks at her in surprise . ] You do_ _n't suppose I ever have anything to do with him ?
That=I ever meet him ?
That=I see anything of him ?
Ella=rentheim . Not even that ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ As before . ] The man was in gaol , in gaol for five years ! [ Covers her face with her hands .
] Oh , the crushing shame of it ! [ With increased vehemence .
] And then to think of all that the name of John=Gabriel=Borkman used to mean !
No , no , no -- I can never see him again !
Never !
Ella=rentheim . [ Looks at her for a while . ] You have a hard heart , Gunhild . Mrs .
Borkman . Towards him , yes .
Ella=rentheim . After all , he is your husband . Mrs .
Borkman . Did he not say in court that it was I who began his ruin ?
That I spent money so recklessly ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Tentatively .
] But is there not some truth in that ? Mrs . Borkman . Why , it was he himself that made me do it !
He insisted on our living in such an absurdly lavish style ----
Ella=rentheim . Yes , I know .
But that is just where you should have restrained him ;
and apparently you did_ _n't . Mrs .
Borkman . How was I to know that it was not his own money he gave me to squander ?
And that he himself used to squander , too -- ten times more=than I did !
Ella=rentheim . [ Quietly .
] Well , I daresay his position forced him to do that -- to=some=extent at=any=rate . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Scornfully .
] Yes , it was always the same story -- we were to « cut a figure . »
And he did « cut a figure » to some purpose !
He used to drive about with a four-in-hand as=if he were a king .
And he had people bowing and scraping to him just as=to a king . [ With a laugh .
] And they always called him by his Christian names -- all the country over -- as=if he had been the king himself .
« John Gabriel , » " John=Gabriel , " « John Gabriel . »
Every one knew what a great man « John=Gabriel » was !
Ella=rentheim . [ Warmly and emphatically . ] He was a great man then . Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , to all appearance .
But he never breathed a single word to me as=to his real position -- never gave a hint as=to where he got his means from .
Ella=rentheim . No , no ;
and other people did not dream of it either . Mrs . Borkman .
I do_ _n't care about the other people . But it was his duty to tell me the truth .
And that he never did !
He kept on lying to me -- lying abominably ----
Ella=rentheim . [ Interrupting . ] Surely not , Gunhild .
He kept things back perhaps , but I am sure he did not lie .
Mrs . Borkman .
Well , well ;
call it what you please ;
it makes no difference .
And then it all fell to pieces -- the whole thing . Ella=rentheim . [ To herself .
] Yes , everything fell to pieces -- for him -- and for others .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Drawing herself up menacingly .
] But=I tell you this , Ella , I do not give in yet !
I shall redeem myself yet -- you may make up your mind to that !
Ella=rentheim . [ Eagerly .
] Redeem yourself !
What do you mean by that ? Mrs . Borkman .
Redeem my name , and honour , and fortune !
Redeem my ruined life -- that is what I mean !
I have some one in reserve , let me tell you -- one who will wash away every stain that he has left .
Ella=rentheim . Gunhild !
Gunhild !
Mrs . Borkman . [ With rising excitement . ] There is an avenger living , I tell you !
One who will make up to me for all his father's sins !
Ella=rentheim . Erhart you mean . Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , Erhart , my own boy !
He will redeem the family , the house , the name .
All that can be redeemed .
-- And perhaps more besides .
Ella=rentheim . And how do you think that is to be done ? Mrs .
Borkman . It must be done as best it can ;
I do_ _n't know how .
But I know that it must and shall be done . [ Looks searchingly at her .
] Come now , Ella ; is_ _n't that really what you have had in mind too , ever since he was a child ?
Ella=rentheim .
No , I can_ _n't exactly say that .
Mrs . Borkman . No ?
Then why did you take charge of him when the storm broke upon -- upon this house ? Ella=rentheim .
You could not look after him yourself at that time , Gunhild . Mrs .
Borkman . No , no , I could not .
And his father -- he had a valid enough excuse -- while he was there -- in safe keeping ----
Ella=rentheim . [ Indignant . ] Oh , how can you say such things !
-- You !
Mrs . Borkman . [ With a venomous expression .
] And how could you make up your mind to take charge of the child of a -- a John=Gabriel !
Just as if he had been your own ?
To take the child away from me -- home with you -- and keep him there year=after=year , until the boy was nearly grown up . [ Looking suspiciously at her .
] What was your real reason , Ella ?
Why did you keep him with you ?
Ella=rentheim . I came to love him so dearly ---- Mrs .
Borkman . More=than I -- his mother ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Evasively . ] I do_ _n't know about that .
And then , you know , Erhart was rather delicate as a child ---- Mrs .
Borkman . Erhart -- delicate ! Ella=rentheim .
Yes , I thought so -- at that time at=any=rate .
And you know the air of the west coast is so much milder than here .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Smiling bitterly .
] H'm -- is it indeed ? [ Breaking off . ] Yes , it is true you have done a great deal for Erhart . [ With a change of tone .
] Well , of=course , you could afford it . [ Smiling .
] You were so lucky , Ella ;
you managed to save all your money .
Ella=rentheim . [ Hurt . ] I did not manage anything about it , I assure you .
Borkman . Well , well ;
I do_ _n't understand anything about these things !
I only say you were lucky . [ Looking inquiringly at her .
] But when you , of your own accord , undertook to educate Erhart for me -- what was your motive in that ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking at her .
] My motive ? Mrs . Borkman .
Yes , some motive you must have had .
What did you want to do with him ?
To make of him , I mean ?
Borkman . [ Contemptuously . ] Pooh -- people situated as we are have something else than happiness to think of .
Ella=rentheim . What , then ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looking steadily and earnestly at her . ] Erhart has in the first place to make so brilliant a position for himself , that no trace shall be left of the shadow his father has cast upon my name -- and my son's .
Borkman . [ Slightly taken aback . ] Yes , I should hope so ! Ella=rentheim .
Is it not rather what you demand of him ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ Curtly . ] Erhart and I always make the same demands upon ourselves .
Borkman . [ With veiled triumph . ] Yes , that I am -- thank Heaven .
You may be sure of that !
Ella=rentheim .
Then I should think in reality you must be happy after all ;
in spite of all the rest . Mrs .
Borkman .
So I am -- so=far as that goes . But then , every moment , all the rest comes rushing in upon me like a storm .
Ella=rentheim . [ With a change of tone . ] Tell me -- you may as=well tell me at once -- for that is really what I have come for ----
Mrs . Borkman .
What ? Ella=rentheim .
Something I felt I must talk to you about .
Borkman . [ Harshly . ] Erhart can_ _not live out here with me .
He has to live in town ----
Ella=rentheim . So he wrote to me . Mrs .
Borkman . He must , for=the=sake=of his studies .
But he comes out to me for a little while every evening .
Ella=rentheim . Well , may I see him then ?
May I speak to him at=once ?
Mrs . Borkman . He has not come yet ;
but I expect him every moment .
Ella=rentheim . Why , Gunhild , surely he must have come .
I can hear his footsteps overhead .
Mrs . Borkman . [ With a rapid upward glance . ] Up in the long gallery ?
Ella=rentheim . Yes .
I have heard him walking up=and=down there ever=since I came .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Looking away from her . ] That is not Erhart , Ella .
Ella=rentheim . [ Surprised . ] Not=Erhart ? [ Divining .
] Who is it then ? Mrs .
Borkman . It is he .
Ella=rentheim . [ Softly , with suppressed pain .
] Borkman ?
John=Gabriel=Borkman ?
Mrs . Borkman .
He walks up=and=down like that -- backwards and forwards -- from morning to night -- day out and day in . Ella=rentheim .
I have heard something of this ----
Mrs . Borkman . I daresay .
People find plenty to say about us , no doubt .
Ella=rentheim .
Erhart has spoken of it in his letters .
He said that his father generally remained by himself -- up there -- and you alone down here .
Mrs . Borkman . Yes ;
that is how it has been , Ella , ever=since they let him out , and sent him home to me .
All these long eight years .
Ella=rentheim .
I never believed it could really be so .
It seemed impossible ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Nods .
] It is so ;
and it can never be otherwise .
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking at her .
] This must be a terrible life , Gunhild . Mrs .
Borkman . Worse than terrible -- almost unendurable .
Ella=rentheim . Yes , it must be . Mrs .
Borkman . Always to hear his footsteps up there -- from early morning till far into the night .
And everything sounds so clear in this house !
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , it is strange how clear the sound is . Mrs . Borkman .
I often feel as=if I had a sick wolf pacing his cage up there in the gallery , right over my head . [ Listens and whispers .
] Hark ! Do you hear !
Backwards and forwards , up=and=down , goes the wolf .
Ella=rentheim . [ Tentatively .
] Is no change possible , Gunhild ? Mrs . Borkman . [ With a gesture of repulsion .
] He has never made any movement towards a change .
Ella=rentheim .
Could you not make the first movement , then ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ Indignantly . ] I ! After all the wrong he has done me !
No thank you !
Rather let the wolf go on prowling up there .
Ella=rentheim . This room is too hot for me .
You must let me take off my things after all . Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , I asked you to .
[ ELLA Rentheim takes off her hat and cloak and lays them on a chair beside the door leading to the hall . Ella=rentheim .
Do you never happen to meet him , away from home ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ With a bitter laugh .
] In society , do you mean ? Ella=rentheim .
I mean , when he goes out walking .
In the woods , or ---- Mrs .
Borkman . He never goes out .
Ella=rentheim . Not even in the twilight ? Mrs .
Borkman . Never .
Ella=rentheim . [ With emotion . ] He can_ _not bring himself to go out ? Mrs .
Borkman . I suppose not .
He has his great cloak and his hat hanging in the cupboard -- the cupboard in the hall , you know ----
Ella=rentheim . [ To herself .
] The cupboard we used to hide in when we were little . Mrs . Borkman . [ Nods .
] And now=and=then -- late in the evening -- I can hear him come down as=though to go out .
But he always stops when he is halfway downstairs , and turns back -- straight back to the gallery .
Ella=rentheim . [ Quietly .
Borkman . He has no old friends .
Ella=rentheim .
He had so many -- once . Mrs .
Borkman . H'm ! He took the best possible way to get rid of them .
He was a dear friend to his friends , was John=Gabriel .
Ella=rentheim . Oh , yes , that is true , Gunhild . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Vehemently . ] All=the=same , I call it mean , petty , base , contemptible of them , to think so much of the paltry losses they may have suffered through him .
They were only money losses , nothing more .
Ella=rentheim . [ Not answering her .
] So he lives up there quite alone . Absolutely by himself .
Mrs . Borkman .
Yes , practically so .
They tell me an old clerk or copyist or something comes out to see him now=and=then .
Ella=rentheim . Ah , indeed ;
no doubt it is a man called Foldal .
I know they were friends as young men . Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , I believe they were .
But I know nothing about him .
He was quite outside our circle -- when we had a circle ----
Ella=rentheim .
So he comes out to see Borkman now ? Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , he condescends to .
But of=course he only comes when it is dark .
Ella=rentheim .
Borkman . [ Carelessly . ] Yes , I believe I heard he had lost some money .
But no doubt it was something quite trifling .
Ella=rentheim . [ With slight emphasis . ] It was all he possessed . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Smiling . ] Oh , well ; what he possessed must have been little enough -- nothing to speak of .
Ella=rentheim .
And he did not speak of it -- Foldal=I mean -- during the investigation . Mrs .
Borkman . At all events , I can assure you Erhart has made ample amends for any little loss he may have suffered .
Ella=rentheim . [ With surprise .
] Erhart ! How can Erhart have done that ? Mrs .
Borkman . He has taken an interest in Foldal's youngest daughter .
He has taught her things , and put her in the way of getting employment , and some day providing for herself .
I am sure that is a great deal more=than her father could ever have done for her .
Borkman . And then Erhart has arranged for her to have lessons in music .
She has made such progress already that she can come up=to -- to him in the gallery , and play to him .
Ella=rentheim . So he is still fond of music ? Mrs .
Borkman . Oh yes , I suppose he is .
Of=course he has the piano you sent out here -- when he was expected back ----
Ella=rentheim . And she plays to him on it ? Mrs . Borkman .
Yes , now=and=then -- in the evenings .
That is Erhart's doing , too .
Ella=rentheim .
Has the poor girl to come all the long way out here , and then back to town again ?
Mrs . Borkman .
No , she does_ _n't need to .
Erhart has arranged for her to stay with a lady who lives near us -- a Mrs.=Wilton ----
Ella=rentheim . [ With interest .
] Mrs.=Wilton ? Mrs .
Borkman . A very rich woman .
You do_ _n't know her .
Ella=rentheim .
I have heard her name . Mrs.=Fanny=Wilton , is it not ---- ? Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , quite right .
Ella=rentheim . Erhart has mentioned her several times .
Does she live out here now ? Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , she has taken a villa here ; she moved out from town some time ago .
Ella=rentheim . [ With a slight hesitation .
] They say she is divorced from her husband . Mrs .
Borkman . Her husband has been dead for several years .
Ella=rentheim . Yes , but they were divorced .
He got a divorce . Mrs .
Borkman . He deserted her , that is what he did .
I am sure the fault was_ _n't hers .
Ella=rentheim . Do you know her at=all intimately , Gunhild ? Mrs .
Borkman . Oh yes , pretty well .
She lives close by here ;
and she looks in every=now=and=then .
Ella=rentheim . And do you like her ? Mrs .
Borkman . She is unusually intelligent ;
remarkably clear in her judgments .
Ella=rentheim . In her judgments of people , do you mean ? Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , principally of people .
She has made quite a study of Erhart ;
looked deep into his character -- into his soul .
And the result is she idolises him , as she could not help doing .
Yes , Erhart saw a good deal of her in-town , before she came out here .
Ella=rentheim . [ Without thinking . ] And in=spite=of that she moved out=of town ?
Mrs . Borkman . [ Taken aback , looking keenly at her .
] In=spite=of that !
What do you mean ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Evasively . ] Oh , nothing particular . Mrs . Borkman .
You said it strangely -- you did mean something by it , Ella !
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking her straight in the eyes .
] Yes , that is true , Gunhild !
I did mean something by it . Mrs .
Borkman . Well , then , say it right out .
Ella=rentheim . First let me tell you , I think I too have a certain claim upon Erhart .
Do you think I have_ _n't ?
Mrs . Borkman . [ Glancing round the room .
] No doubt -- after all the money you have spent upon him .
Ella=rentheim . Oh , not on that account , Gunhild .
But because I love him .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Smiling scornfully . ] Love my son ?
Is it possible ?
You ?
In spite of everything ?
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , it is possible -- in=spite=of everything .
And it is true .
I love Erhart -- as=much=as I can love any one -- now -- at my time of life . Mrs .
Borkman .
Well , well , suppose you do : what then ?
Ella=rentheim .
Borkman . Threatening Erhart !
Why , what should threaten him ?
Or who ?
Ella=rentheim . You in the first place -- in your way . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Vehemently . ] I ! Ella=rentheim .
And then this Mrs.=Wilton , too , I am afraid . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looks at her for a moment in speechless surprise . ] And you think such things of Erhart !
Of my own boy !
He , who has his great mission to fulfil !
Ella=rentheim . [ Lightly . ] Oh , his mission ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Indignantly . ] How dare you say that so scornfully ? Ella=rentheim .
Borkman . [ Firmly and emphatically . ] Erhart will !
I know he will .
Ella=rentheim . [ Shaking her head . ] You neither know it nor believe it , Gunhild . Mrs .
Borkman . I do_ _n't believe it !
Ella=rentheim . It is only a dream that you cherish .
Borkman . Yes , indeed I should despair . [ Vehemently .
] And=I daresay that is what you would like to see , Ella !
Borkman . [ Threateningly . ] You want to come between us ?
Between mother and son ?
You ?
Ella=rentheim . I want to free him from your power -- your will -- your despotism .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Triumphantly .
] You are too late ! You had him in your nets all these years -- until he was fifteen .
But now I have won him again , you see !
Ella=rentheim . Then I will win him back from you ! [ Hoarsely , half whispering .
] We two have fought a life-and-death battle before , Gunhild -- for a man's soul ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looking at her in triumph . ] Yes , and I won the victory .
Ella=rentheim . [ With a smile of scorn .
Borkman . [ Darkly . ] No ;
Heaven knows you are right there .
Ella=rentheim . You need look for no victory worth the winning this time either . Mrs .
Borkman . Not when I am fighting to preserve a mother's power over my son !
Ella=rentheim .
No ; for it is only power over him that you want . Mrs .
Borkman . And you ?
Borkman . [ With an outburst . ] That you shall never have in this world !
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking at her . ] You have seen to that ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ Smiling . ] Yes , I have taken that liberty .
Could you not see that in his letters ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Nods slowly . ] Yes .
I could see you -- the whole of you -- in his letters of=late . Mrs . Borkman . [ Gallingly .
] I have made the best use of these eight years . I have had him under my own eye , you see .
Ella=rentheim . [ Controlling herself . ] What have you said to Erhart about me ?
Is it the sort of thing you can tell me ? Mrs .
Borkman . Oh yes , I can tell you well enough .
Ella=rentheim . Then please do . Mrs .
Borkman . I have only told him the truth .
Ella=rentheim . Well ?
Mrs . Borkman . I have impressed upon him , every day of his life , that he must never forget that it is you we have to thank for being able to live as we do -- for being able to live at=all .
Ella=rentheim .
Is that all ? Mrs . Borkman .
Oh , that is the sort of thing that rankles ;
I feel that in my own heart .
Ella=rentheim . But that is very much what Erhart knew already . Mrs .
Borkman . When he came home to me , he imagined that you did it all-out of goodness of heart . [ Looks malignly at her .
] Now he does not believe that any longer , Ella . Ella=rentheim .
Then what does he believe now ? Mrs .
Borkman . He believes what is the truth .
I asked him how he accounted for the fact that Aunt=Ella never came here to visit us ----
Ella=rentheim . [ Interrupting . ] He knew my reasons already ! Mrs .
Borkman . He knows them better now .
You had got him to believe that it was to spare me and -- and him up there in gallery ----
Ella=rentheim . And so it was . Mrs .
Borkman . Erhart does not believe that for a moment , now .
Ella=rentheim . What have you put in his head ? Mrs .
Borkman . He thinks , what is the truth , that you are ashamed of us -- that you despise us .
And do you pretend that you do_ _n't ?
Were you not once planning to take him quite away from me ?
Think , Ella ;
you can_ _not have forgotten .
Ella=rentheim . [ With a gesture of negation .
] That was at the height of the scandal -- when the case was before the courts .
I have no=such designs now . Mrs .
Borkman . And it would not matter if you had .
For in that case what would become of his mission ?
No , thank you .
It is me that Erhart needs -- not you .
And therefore he is as good as dead to you -- and you to him .
Ella=rentheim . [ Coldly , with resolution .
] We shall see . For now I shall remain out here .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Stares at her . ] Here ? In this house ?
Ella=rentheim . Yes , here . Mrs .
Borkman . Here -- with us ?
Remain all-night ?
Ella=rentheim . I shall remain here all the rest of my days if=need=be . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Collecting herself . ] Very well , Ella ; the house is yours ----
Ella=rentheim . Oh , nonsense ----
Mrs . Borkman . Everything is yours .
The chair I am sitting in is yours .
The bed I lie and toss in at night belongs to you .
The food we eat comes to us from you .
Ella=rentheim . It can_ _n't be arranged otherwise , you know .
Borkman can hold no property of his own ;
for some one would at=once come and take it from him . Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , I know .
We must be content to live upon your pity and charity .
Borkman . No , you can_ _not .
When do you want us to move out ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking at her . ] Move out ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ In great excitement . ] Yes ; you do_ _n't imagine that I will go on living under the same roof with you !
I tell you , I would rather go to the workhouse or tramp the roads !
Ella=rentheim . Good .
Then let me take Erhart with me ---- Mrs .
Borkman . Erhart ?
My own son ?
My child ?
Ella=rentheim . Yes ; for then I would go straight home again . Mrs .
Borkman . [ After reflecting a moment , firmly . ] Erhart himself shall choose between us .
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking doubtfully and hesitatingly at her .
] He choose ? Dare you risk that , Gunhild ?
Mrs . Borkman . [ With a hard laugh . ] Dare=I ?
Let my boy choose between his mother and you ?
Yes , indeed I dare !
Ella=rentheim . [ Listening . ] Is there some one coming ?
I thought I heard ---- Mrs .
Borkman . Then it must be Erhart .
[ There is a sharp knock at the door leading in from the hall , which is immediately opened .
Mrs . Wilton enters , in evening dress , and with outer wraps .
She is followed by The Maid , who has not had time to announce her , and looks bewildered .
The door remains half-open .
Mrs . Wilton is a strikingly handsome , well-developed woman in the thirties .
Broad , red , smiling lips , sparkling eyes .
Luxuriant dark hair .
Mrs . Wilton . Good evening , my dearest Mrs.=Borkman !
Mrs .
Borkman . [ Rather drily . ] Good evening , Mrs.=Wilton . [ To The Maid , pointing toward the garden-room .
] Take the lamp that is in=there and light it .
[ The Maid takes the lamp and goes out with it .
Mrs . Wilton . [ Observing Ella=rentheim .
] Oh , I beg your pardon -- you have a visitor .
Mrs .
Borkman . Only my sister , who has just arrived from ----
[ Erhart Borkman flings the half-open door wide open and rushes in .
He is a young man with bright cheerful eyes .
He is well-dressed ;
his moustache is beginning to grow .
Erhart . [ Radiant with joy ;
on the threshold .
] What is this !
Is=Aunt Ella here ? [ Rushing up=to her and seizing her hands .
] Aunt , aunt ! Is it possible ?
Are you here ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Throws her arms round his neck . ] Erhart !
My dear , dear boy !
Why , how big you have grown !
Oh , how good it is to see you again ! Mrs .
Wilton . [ Quickly . ] Erhart -- Mr.=Borkman came in with me . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looking hard at him . ] Indeed , Erhart !
You do_ _n't come to your mother first ?
Erhart . I had just to look in at Mrs.=Wilton's for a moment -- to call for little Frida . Mrs .
Borkman . Is that Miss=Foldal with you too ? Mrs .
Wilton . Yes , we have left her in the hall .
Erhart . [ Addressing some one through the open door . ] You can go right upstairs , Frida .
[ Pause .
Ella=rentheim observes Erhart .
He seems embarrassed and a=little impatient ;
his face has assumed a nervous and colder expression .
[ The Maid brings the lighted lamp into the garden-room , goes out again and closes the door behind her .
Mrs .
Wilton . Many thanks , my dear lady , but I really can_ _n't .
We have another invitation .
We_ _re going down to the Hinkels' .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Looking at her .
] We ?
Whom do you mean by we ?
Mrs . Wilton . [ Laughing .
Borkman . And you did happen to see him , it appears . Mrs .
Wilton . Yes , fortunately .
He was good enough to look in at my house -- to call for Frida . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Drily . ] But , Erhart , I did not know that you knew that family -- those Hinkels ? Erhart . [ Irritated .
] No , I do_ _n't exactly know them . [ Adds rather impatiently .
Oh , it does_ _n't matter !
They soon put you at your ease in that house !
They are such cheerful , hospitable people -- the house swarms with young ladies . Mrs .
Borkman . [ With emphasis .
Wilton . Why , good gracious , dear lady , he is young , too , you know ! Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , fortunately he_ _s young .
He would need to be young .
Erhart . [ Concealing his impatience . ] Well , well , well , mother , it_ _s quite clear I can_ _n't got to the Hinkels' this evening .
Of=course I shall remain here with you and Aunt=Ella . Mrs .
Borkman . I knew you would , my dear Erhart . Ella=rentheim .
No , Erhart , you must not stop at home on my account ----
Erhart . Yes , indeed , my dear Aunt ;
I can_ _n't think of going . [ Looking doubtfully at Mrs .
Wilton . ] But how shall we manage ?
Can=I get out=of it ?
You have said « Yes » for me , have_ _n't you ?
Mrs . Wilton . [ Gaily . ] What nonsense !
Not get out=of it !
When=I make my entrance into the festive halls -- just imagine it ! -- deserted and forlorn -- then I must simply say « No » for you . Erhart . [ Hesitatingly .
] Well , if you really think I can get out=of it ---- Mrs .
Wilton . [ Putting the matter lightly aside . ] I am quite used to saying both yes and no -- on my own account .
And you can_ _n't possibly think of leaving your aunt the moment she has arrived !
For shame , Monsieur=Erhart !
Would that be behaving like a good son ? Mrs . Borkman . [ Annoyed .
] Son ? Mrs . Wilton .
Well , adopted son then , Mrs.=Borkman . Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , you may well add that . Mrs .
Borkman . Has that been your experience ? Mrs .
Wilton . I knew very little of my own mother , I am sorry to say .
But if I had had a good foster-mother , perhaps I should_ _n't have been so -- so naughty , as people say I am . [ Turning towards Erhart .
] Well , then we stop peaceably at home-like a good boy , and drink tea with mamma and auntie ! [ To the ladies .
] Good-bye , good-bye Mrs. Borkman !
Good-bye Miss=Rentheim .
[ The ladies bow silently .
She goes toward the door .
Erhart . [ Following her .
] Shall_ _n't I go a little bit of the way with you ? Mrs .
Wilton . [ In the doorway , motioning him back .
] You shall_ _n't go a step with me .
I am quite accustomed to taking my walks alone . [ Stops on the threshold , looks at him and nods .
What am I to beware of ?
Mrs . Wilton . [ Gaily .
] Why , as I go down the road -- deserted and forlorn , as I said before -- I shall try if I can_ _n't cast a spell upon you . Erhart . [ Laughing .
] Oh , indeed !
Are you going to try that again ? Mrs .
Wilton . [ Half seriously . ] Yes , just you beware !
As=I go down the road , I will say in my own mind -- right from the very centre of my will --
I will say : « Mr. Erhart=Borkman , take your hat at=once ! »
Mrs . Borkman .
And you think he will take it ?
Mrs . Wilton . [ Laughing . ] Good=heavens , yes , he_ _ll snatch up his hat instantly . And then I will say : " Now put on your overcoat , like a good boy , Erhart=Borkman !
And your goloshes !
Be sure you do_ _n't forget the goloshes !
And then follow me !
Do as I bid you , as I bid you , as I bid you ! "
Erhart . [ With forced gaiety . ] Oh , you may rely on that . Mrs .
Wilton . [ Raising her forefinger . ] As=I bid you !
As=I bid you !
Good-night !
[ She laughs and nods to the ladies , and closes the door behind her .
Mrs .
Borkman . Does she really play tricks of that sort ?
Erhart . Oh , not at=all .
How can you think so !
She only says it in fun . [ Breaking off .
] To think of your having taken all this long journey , Aunt=Ella !
And in winter too !
Ella=rentheim . I found I had to , Erhart . Erhart .
Indeed ?
Why so ?
Ella=rentheim . I had to come to town after all , to consult the doctors .
Erhart . Oh , I_ _m glad of that !
Ella=rentheim . [ Smiling . ] Are you glad of that ? Erhart .
I mean I am glad you made up your mind to it at=last .
Mrs . Borkman . [ On the sofa , coldly .
] Are you ill , Ella ?
Borkman . I knew you were not strong , and had_ _n't been for years .
There is no=one in my neighbourhood that I have any real confidence in .
And , besides , I did not feel it so much at that time .
Erhart . Are you worse , then , Aunt ?
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , my dear boy ; I am worse now . Erhart .
But there_ _s nothing dangerous ?
Ella=rentheim . Oh , that depends how you look at it .
Erhart . [ Emphatically . ] Well , then , I tell you what it is , Aunt=Ella ;
you must_ _n't think of going home again for the present . Ella=rentheim . No , I am not thinking of it .
Erhart . You must remain in-town ;
for here you can have your choice of all the best doctors .
Ella=rentheim . That was what I thought when I left home . Erhart .
And then you must be sure and find a really nice place to live -- quiet , comfortable rooms .
Ella=rentheim . I went this morning to the old ones , where I used to stay before . Erhart .
Oh , well , you were comfortable enough there .
Ella=rentheim . Yes , but I shall not be staying there after all .
Erhart . Indeed ?
Why not ?
Ella=rentheim . I changed my mind after coming out here .
Erhart . [ Surprised .
] Really ? Changed you mind ?
Mrs . Borkman . [ Crocheting ;
without looking up . ] Your aunt will live here , in her own house , Erhart .
Erhart . [ Looking from one to the other alternately .
] Here , with us ?
Is this true , Aunt ?
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , that is what I made up my mind to do . Mrs . Borkman . [ As before .
] Everything here belongs to your aunt , you know .
Ella=rentheim .
I intend to remain here , Erhart -- just now -- for the present .
I shall set up a little establishment of my own , over in the bailiff's wing .
Erhart . Ah , that_ _s a good idea .
There are plenty=of rooms there . [ With sudden vivacity .
] But , by-the-bye , Aunt -- are_ _n't you very tired after your journey ?
Ella=rentheim . Oh yes , rather tired .
Erhart . Well , then , I think you ought=to go quite early to bed .
Ella=rentheim . [ Looks at him smilingly . ] I mean to .
Borkman . [ With an outburst , rising from the sofa .
] Erhart , I can see you are going to leave me !
Erhart . [ Starts .
] What do you mean by that ?
Mrs . Borkman .
You are going down to -- to the Hinkels' ?
Erhart . [ Involuntarily .
] Oh , that ! [ Collecting himself .
] Well , you would_ _n't have me sit here and keep Aunt=Ella up half the night ?
Remember , she_ _s an invalid , mother .
Mrs . Borkman .
You are going to the Hinkels' , Erhart !
Erhart . [ Impatiently . ] Well , really , mother , I do_ _n't think I can well get out=of it .
What do you say , Aunt ?
Ella=rentheim . I should like you to feel quite free , Erhart . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Goes up=to her menacingly . ] You want to take him away from me !
Ella=rentheim . [ Rising . ] Yes , if only I could , Gunhild ! [ Music is heard from above .
Erhart . [ Writhing as=if in pain .
] Oh , I can_ _n't endure this ! [ Looking round .
] What have I done with my hat ? [ To Ella=rentheim .
] Do you know the air that she is playing up there ?
Ella=rentheim .
No. What is it ?
Erhart . It_ _s the _Danse Macabre_ -- the Dance=of=Death !
Do_ _n't you know the Dance=of=Death , Aunt ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Smiling sadly .
] Not=yet , Erhart . Erhart . [ To Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looks hardly at him . ] Away from your mother ?
So=that is what you want to do ?
Erhart . Of=course I_ _ll come out again -- to-morrow perhaps . Mrs .
Borkman . [ With passionate emotion . ] You want to go away from me !
To be with those strange people !
With -- with -- no , I will not even think of it ! Erhart .
There are bright lights down there , and young , happy faces ;
and there_ _s music there , mother ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Pointing upwards .
] There is music here , too , Erhart . Erhart .
Yes , it_ _s just that music that drives me out=of the house .
Ella=rentheim . Do you grudge your father a moment of self-forgetfulness ?
Erhart . No , I do_ _n't .
I_ _m very , very glad that he should have it -- if only _I_ do_ _n't have to listen . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looking solemnly at him .
] Be strong , Erhart !
Be strong , my son !
Do not forget that you have your great mission .
Erhart . Oh , mother -- do spare me these phrases !
I was_ _n't born to be a « missionary . »
-- Good-night , aunt dear !
Good-night , mother . [ He goes hastily out through the hall .
Mrs .
Borkman . [ After a short silence . ] It has not taken you long to recapture him , Ella , after all .
Ella=rentheim . I wish I could believe it . Mrs .
Borkman . But you shall see you will_ _n't be allowed to keep him long .
Ella=rentheim . Allowed ?
By you , do you mean ? Mrs . Borkman . By me or -- by her , the other one ----
Ella=rentheim . Then rather she than you . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Nodding slowly . ] That=I understand .
I say the same .
Rather she than you .
Ella=rentheim . Whatever should become of him in the end ---- Mrs .
Borkman . It would_ _n't greatly matter , I should say .
Ella=rentheim . [ Taking her outdoor things upon her arm. ] For the first time in our lives , we twin sisters are of one mind .
Good-night , Gunhild .
[ She goes out by the hall .
The music sounds louder from above .
Mrs .
Borkman . [ Stands still for a moment , starts , shrinks together , and whispers involuntarily .
] The wolf is whining again -- the sick wolf . [ She stands still for a moment , then flings herself down on the floor , writhing in agony and whispering : ] Erhart !
Erhart !
-- be true to me !
Oh , come home and help your mother !
For=I can bear this life no=longer !
Act Second
The great gallery on the first floor of the Rentheim=House .
The walls are covered with old tapestries , representing hunting-scenes , shepherds and shepherdesses , all in faded colours .
A folding-door to the left , and further forward a piano .
In the left-hand corner , at the back , a door , cut in the tapestry , and covered with tapestry , without any frame .
Against the middle of the right wall , a large writing-table of carved oak , with many books and papers .
Further forward on the same side , a sofa with a table and chairs in=front of it .
The furniture is all of a stiff Empire style .
Lighted lamps on both tables .
JOHN=GABRIEL=BORKMAN stands with his hands behind his back , beside the piano , listening to Frida=foldal , who is playing the last bars of the « Danse=Macabre . »
Borkman is of middle height , a well-knit , powerfully-built man , well on in the sixties .
His appearance is distinguished , his profile finely cut , his eyes piercing , his hair and beard curly and greyish-white .
He is dressed in a slightly old-fashioned black coat , and wears a white necktie .
Frida Foldal is a pretty , pale girl of fifteen , with a somewhat weary and overstrained expression .
She is cheaply dressed in light colours . Borkman .
Can you guess where I first heard tones like these ? Frida . [ Looking up at him .
] No , Mr.=Borkman .
Borkman . It was down in the mines .
Frida . [ Not understanding . ] Indeed ?
Down in the mines ? Borkman .
I am a miner's son , you know . Or perhaps you did not know ?
Frida . No , Mr.=Borkman .
Borkman . A miner's son .
And my father used sometimes to take me with him into the mines .
The metal sings down there .
Frida . Really ? Sings ?
Borkman . [ Nodding . ] When it is loosened .
The hammer-strokes that loosen it are the midnight bell clanging to set it free ;
and that is why the metal sings -- in its own way -- for gladness .
Frida . Why does it do that , Mr.=Borkman ?
Borkman .
It wants to come up into the light of day and serve mankind . [ He paces up=and=down the gallery , always with his hands behind his back .
Frida . [ Sits waiting a little , then looks at her watch and rises .
] I beg your pardon , Mr.=Borkman ;
but I am afraid I must go .
Borkman . [ Stopping before her . ] Are you going already ?
Frida . [ Putting her music in its case . ] I really must . [ Visibly embarrassed .
] I have an engagement this evening .
Borkman . For a party ? Frida .
Yes .
Borkman . And you are to play before the company ?
Frida . [ Biting her lip . ] No ; at=least I am only to play for dancing .
Borkman . Only for dancing ?
Frida . Yes ;
there is to be a dance after supper . Borkman . [ Stands and looks at her .
] Do you like playing dance music ? At parties , I mean ?
Frida . [ Putting on her outdoor things .
] Yes , when I can get an engagement .
I can always earn a little in that way .
Borkman . [ With interest . ] Is that the principal thing in your mind as you sit playing for the dancers ?
Frida . No ;
I_ _m generally thinking how hard it is that I mayn't join in the dance myself .
Borkman . [ Nodding . ] That is just what I wanted to know . [ Moving restlessly about the room .
] Yes , yes , yes . That you must not join in the dance , that is the hardest thing of all . [ Stopping .
] But there is one thing that should make up to you for that , Frida .
Frida . [ Looking inquiringly at him . ] What is that , Mr.=Borkman ? Borkman .
The knowledge that you have ten times more music in you than all the dancers together .
Frida . [ Smiling evasively . ] Oh , that_ _s not at=all so certain .
Borkman . [ Holding up his fore-finger warningly . ] You must never be so mad as=to have doubts of yourself !
Frida . But since no=one knows it ----
Borkman . So long as you know it yourself , that is enough .
Where is it you are going to play this evening ? Frida . Over at the Hinkel's .
Borkman . [ With a swift , keen glance at her .
] Hinkel's , you say ! Frida .
Yes .
Borkman . [ With a cutting smile . ] Does that man give parties ?
Can he get people to visit him ?
Frida . Yes , they have a great many people about them , Mrs.=Wilton says .
Borkman . [ Vehemently . ] But what sort of people ?
Can you tell me that ?
Frida . [ A little nervously . ] No , I really do_ _n't know .
Yes , by-the-bye , I know that young Mr.=Borkman is to be there this evening .
Borkman . [ Taken aback . ] Erhart ?
My son ?
Frida . Yes , he is going there .
Borkman . How do you know that ?
Frida . He said so himself -- an hour ago .
Borkman .
Is he out here to-day ? Frida .
Yes , he has been at Mrs.=Wilton's all the afternoon .
Borkman . [ Inquiringly . ] Do you know if he called here too ?
I mean , did he see any one downstairs ? Frida .
Yes , he looked in to see Mrs.=Borkman . Borkman . [ Bitterly .
] Aha -- I might have known it . Frida .
There was a strange lady calling upon her , I think .
Borkman .
Indeed ? Was there ?
Oh yes , I suppose people do come now and then to see Mrs.=Borkman .
Frida . If I meet young Mr.=Borkman this evening , shall I ask him to come up and see you too ? Borkman . [ Harshly .
] You shall do nothing of the sort !
I will_ _n't have it on any account .
The people who want to see me can come of their own accord . Frida .
Oh , very well ;
I shall_ _n't say anything then .
Good-night , Mr. Borkman .
Borkman . [ Pacing up=and=down and growling . ] Good-night .
Frida . Do you mind if I run down by the winding stair ?
It_ _s the shortest way . Borkman . Oh , by all means ;
take whatever stair you please , so=far as I am concerned .
Good-night to you !
Frida . Good-night , Mr.=Borkman .
[ Borkman , lost in thought , goes up=to the piano , and is about to close it , but changes his mind .
Looks round the great empty room , and sets to pacing up=and=down it from the corner at the back on the right -- pacing backward and forward uneasily and incessantly .
[ A knock at the folding door .
Borkman hears it , looks rapidly towards the door , but says nothing .
[ In a little there comes another knock , this time louder .
Borkman . [ Standing beside the writing-table with his left hand resting upon it , and his right thrust in the breast of his coat .
] Come in ! [ Vilhelm Foldal comes softly into the room .
He is a bent and worn man with mild blue eyes and long , thin grey hair straggling down over his coat collar .
He has a portfolio under his arm , a soft felt hat , and large horn spectacles , which he pushes up over his forehead .
Borkman . [ Changes his attitude and looks at Foldal with a half disappointed , half pleased expression . ] Oh , is it only you ?
Foldal . Good evening , John=Gabriel .
Yes , you see it is me .
Borkman . [ With a stern glance . ] I must say you are rather a late visitor .
Foldal . Well , you know , it_ _s a good bit of a way , especially when you have to trudge it on foot .
Borkman .
But why do you always walk , Vilhelm ?
The tramway passes your door . Foldal .
It_ _s better for you to walk -- and then you always save twopence .
Well , has Frida been playing to you lately ?
Borkman . She has just this moment gone .
Did you not meet her outside ? Foldal .
No , I have seen nothing of her for a long-time ;
not since she went to live with this Mrs.=Wilton .
Borkman . [ Seating himself on the sofa and waving his hand toward a chair . ] You may sit down , Vilhelm .
Foldal . [ Seating himself on the edge of a chair . ] Many thanks . [ Looks mournfully at him . ] You can_ _n't think how lonely I feel since Frida left home .
Borkman . Oh , come -- you have plenty left . Foldal .
Yes , God knows I have -- five of them .
But Frida was the only one who at=all understood me . [ Shaking his head sadly .
] The others do_ _n't understand me a=bit .
Borkman . [ Gloomily , gazing straight before him , and drumming on the table with his fingers .
] No , that_ _s just it . That is the curse we exceptional , chosen people have to bear .
The common herd -- the average man and woman -- they do not understand us , Vilhelm .
Foldal . [ With resignation .
] If it were only the lack of understanding -- with a=little patience , one could manage to wait for that awhile yet . [ His voice choked with tears .
] But there is something still bitterer .
Borkman . [ Vehemently . ] There is nothing bitterer than that .
Foldal . Yes , there is , John=Gabriel .
I have gone through a domestic scene to-night -- just before I started .
Borkman . Indeed ?
What about ?
Foldal . [ With an outburst . ] My people at home -- they despise me . Borkman . [ Indignantly .
] Despise ---- ?
Foldal . [ Wiping his eyes .
] I have long known it ;
but to-day it came out unmistakably . Borkman . [ After a short silence . ] You made an unwise choice , I fear , when you married . Foldal .
I had practically no choice in the matter .
And , you see , one feels a need for companionship as one begins to get on in years .
And so crushed as I then was -- so utterly broken down ----
Borkman . [ Jumping up in anger .
] Is this meant for me ?
A reproach ---- ! Foldal . [ Alarmed . ] No , no , for Heaven's sake , John=Gabriel ---- !
Borkman . Yes , you are thinking of the disaster to the bank , I can see you are .
Foldal . [ Soothingly . ] But=I do_ _n't blame you for that !
Heaven forbid !
Borkman . [ Growling , resumes his seat .
] Well , that is a good thing , at any rate .
Foldal . Besides , you must_ _n't think it is my wife that I complain of .
It is true she has not=much polish , poor thing ;
but she is a good sort of woman all=the=same .
No , it_ _s the children .
Borkman . I thought as much .
Foldal . For the children -- well , they have more culture and therefore they expect more of life .
Borkman . [ Looking at him sympathetically .
] And so your children despise you , Vilhelm ?
Foldal . [ Shrugging his shoulders .
] I have_ _n't made much of a career , you see -- there is no denying that .
Borkman . [ Moving nearer to him , and laying his hand upon his arm. ] Do they not know , then , that in your young days you wrote a tragedy ?
Foldal . Yes , of=course they know that .
But it does_ _n't seem to make much impression on them .
Borkman . Then they do_ _n't understand these things . For your tragedy is good .
I am firmly convinced of that .
Foldal . [ Brightening up . ] Yes , do_ _n't you think there are some good things in it , John=Gabriel ?
Good=God , if I could only manage to get it placed ---- ! [ Opens his portfolio , and begins eagerly turning over the contents . ] Look here !
Just let me show you one or two alterations I have made .
Borkman . Have you it with you ?
Foldal . Yes , I thought I would bring it .
It_ _s so long now since I have read it to you .
And I thought perhaps it might amuse you to hear an act or two .
Borkman . [ Rising , with a negative gesture . ] No , no , we will keep that for another time . Foldal .
Well , well , as you please .
[ Borkman paces up=and=down the room .
Foldal puts the manuscript up again .
Borkman . [ Stopping in=front of him . ] You are quite right in what you said just now -- you have not made any career .
But I promise you this , Vilhelm , that when once the hour of my restoration strikes ----
Foldal . [ Making a movement to rise .
] Oh , thanks , thanks !
Borkman . [ Waving his hand .
] No , please be seated . [ With rising excitement .
] When the hour of my restoration strikes -- when they see that they can_ _not get on without me -- when they come to me , here in the gallery , and crawl to my feet , and beseech me to take the reins of the bank again ---- !
The new bank , that they have founded and can_ _n't carry on ---- [ Placing himself beside the writing-table in the same attitude as before , and striking his breast . ] Here I shall stand , and receive them !
And it shall be known far and wide , all the country over , what conditions John=Gabriel=Borkman imposes before he will ---- [ Stopping suddenly and staring at Foldal . ] You_ _re looking so doubtfully at me !
Perhaps you do not believe that they will come ?
That they must , must , must come to me some day ?
Do you not believe it ?
Foldal . Yes , Heaven knows I do , John=Gabriel .
Borkman . [ Seating himself again on the sofa . ] I firmly believe it .
I am immovably convinced -- I know that they will come .
If I had not been certain of that I would have put a bullet through my head long-ago .
Foldal . [ Anxiously . ] Oh no , for Heaven's sake ---- !
Borkman . [ Exultantly . ] But they will come !
They will come sure enough !
You shall see !
I expect them any day , any moment .
And you see , I hold myself in readiness to receive them .
Foldal . [ With a sigh . ] If only they would come quickly .
Borkman . [ Restlessly .
] Yes , time flies : the years slip away ;
life ---- Ah , no -- I dare not think of it ! [ Looking at him .
] Do you know what I sometimes feel like ? Foldal . What ?
Borkman .
I feel like a Napoleon who has been maimed in his first battle .
Foldal . [ Placing his hand upon his portfolio . ] I have that feeling too . Borkman .
Oh , well , that is on a smaller scale , of=course .
Foldal . [ Quietly . ] My little world of poetry is very precious to me , John=Gabriel .
Borkman . [ Vehemently . ] Yes , but think of me , who could have created millions !
All the mines I should have controlled !
New veins innumerable !
And the water-falls !
And the quarries !
And the trade routes , and the steamship-lines all the wide world over !
I would have organised it all -- I alone !
Foldal . Yes , I know , I know .
There was nothing in the world you would have shrunk from . Borkman . [ Clenching his hands together .
That is my fate too .
Borkman . [ Not noticing him .
] Only to think of it ; so near to the goal as I was !
If=I had only had another week to look about me !
All the deposits would have been covered .
All the securities I had dealt with so daringly should have been in their places again as before .
Vast companies were within a hair's-breadth of being floated .
Not a soul should have lost a half-penny .
Foldal . Yes , yes ; you were on the very verge of success .
Borkman . [ With suppressed fury . ] And then treachery overtook me !
Just at the critical moment ! [ Looking at him .
No , tell me .
Borkman .
It is not murder .
It is not robbery or house-breaking .
It is not even perjury .
What is the=worst=of=all then , John=Gabriel ?
Borkman . [ With emphasis . ] The most infamous of crimes is a friend's betrayal of his friend's confidence .
Foldal . [ Somewhat doubtfully . ] Yes , but you know ----
Borkman . [ Firing up . ] What are you going to say ?
I see it in your face .
But it is of no use .
I tell you the most infamous crime a man can commit is to misuse a friend's letters ;
to publish to all the world what has been confided to him alone , in the closest secrecy , like a whisper in an empty , dark , double-locked room .
The man who can do such things is infected and poisoned in every fibre with the morals of the higher rascality .
And such a friend was mine -- and it was he who crushed me .
Foldal . I can guess whom you mean .
Borkman . There was not a nook or cranny of my life that I hesitated to lay open to him .
I have never been able to understand why he ---- Of=course , there were whispers of all sorts at the time .
Borkman . What were the whispers ?
Tell me .
You see I know nothing .
For I had to go straight into -- into isolation .
What did people whisper , Vilhelm ? Foldal .
You were to have gone into the Cabinet , they said .
Borkman . I was offered a portfolio , but I refused it .
Foldal .
Then it was_ _n't there you stood in his way ?
Borkman . Oh , no ;
that was not the reason he betrayed me .
Foldal . Then I really can_ _n't understand ----
Borkman . I may as=well tell you , Vilhelm ----
Foldal . Well ?
Borkman . There was -- in=fact , there was a woman in the case .
Foldal . A woman in the case ?
Well but , John=Gabriel ----
Borkman . [ Interrupting . ] Well , well -- let us say no=more of these stupid old stories .
After all , neither of us got into the Cabinet , neither he nor I .
Foldal . But he rose high in the world .
Borkman . And I fell into the abyss .
Foldal . Oh , it_ _s a terrible tragedy ----
Borkman . [ Nodding to him . ] Almost as terrible as yours , I fancy , when I come to think of it .
Foldal . [ Naively . ] Yes , at=least as terrible .
Borkman . [ Laughing quietly . ] But looked at from another point of view , it is really a sort of comedy as=well .
Foldal . A comedy ?
The story of your life ? Borkman .
Yes , it seems to be taking a turn in that direction .
For let me tell you ----
Foldal . What ?
Borkman .
You say you did not meet Frida as you came in ?
Foldal . No. Borkman .
I had_ _n't the least idea of that .
Borkman . Yes , she took her music , and went straight from me to -- to the great house .
Foldal . [ Apologetically . ] Well , you see , poor child ----
Borkman . And can you guess for whom she is playing -- among the rest ?
Foldal .
No. Borkman . For my son .
Foldal . What ?
Borkman .
What do you think of that , Vilhelm ?
My son is down there in the whirl of the dance this evening .
Am=I not right in calling it a comedy ?
Foldal . But in that case you may be sure he knows nothing about it .
Borkman . What does he know ?
Foldal . You may be sure he does_ _n't know how he -- that man ----
Borkman . Do not shrink from his name .
I can quite well bear it now .
Foldal . I_ _m certain your son does_ _n't know the circumstances , John=Gabriel .
Borkman . [ Gloomily , sitting and beating the table . ] Yes , he knows , as surely as I am sitting here .
Foldal . Then how can he possibly be a guest in that house ?
Borkman . [ Shaking his head . ] My son probably does not see things with my eyes .
I_ _ll take my oath he is on my enemies' side !
But , my dear friend , who can have got him to see things in that light ?
Borkman . Who ?
Do you forget who has brought him up ?
First his aunt , from the time he was six or seven years old ;
and now , of=late years , his mother !
Foldal . I believe you are doing them an injustice .
Borkman . [ Firing up . ] I never do any one injustice !
Both of them have gone and poisoned his mind against me , I tell you !
Foldal . [ Soothingly .
] Well , well , well , I suppose they have .
Borkman . [ Indignantly . ] Oh these women !
They wreck and ruin life for us !
Play the devil with our whole destiny -- our triumphal progress .
Foldal . Not all of them !
Borkman . Indeed ?
Can you tell me of a single one that is good for anything ?
Foldal . No , that is the trouble .
The few that I know are good for nothing .
Borkman . [ With a snort of scorn . ] Well then , what is the good of it ?
What is the good of such women existing -- if you never know them ?
Foldal . [ Warmly . ] Yes , John=Gabriel , there is good in it , I assure you .
It is such a blessed , beneficial thought that here or there in the world , somewhere , far away -- the true woman exists after all .
Borkman . [ Moving impatiently on the sofa . ] Oh , do spare me that poetical nonsense .
Foldal . [ Looks at him , deeply wounded . ] Do you call my holiest faith poetical nonsense ?
Borkman . [ Harshly . ] Yes=I do !
That is what has always prevented you from getting on in the world .
If you would get all that out=of your head , I could still help you on in life -- help you to rise .
Foldal . [ Boiling inwardly . ] Oh , you can_ _n't do that .
Borkman . I can when once I come into power again .
Foldal . That will_ _n't be for many a day .
Borkman . [ Vehemently . ] Perhaps you think that day will never come ?
Answer me ! Foldal .
I do_ _n't know what to answer .
Borkman . [ Rising , cold and dignified , and waving his hand towards the door .
] Then=I no=longer have any use for you . Foldal . [ Starting up .
] No use ---- ! Borkman .
Since you do not believe that the tide will turn for me ----
Foldal . How can I believe in the teeth of all reason ?
You would have to be legally rehabilitated ----
Borkman . Go on !
go on ! Foldal .
It_ _s true I never passed my examination ;
but I have read enough law to know that ----
Borkman . [ Quickly . ] It is impossible , you mean ?
Foldal . There is no precedent for such a thing .
Borkman . Exceptional men are above precedents . Foldal .
The law knows nothing of such distinctions .
Borkman . [ Harshly and decisively . ] You are no poet , Vilhelm .
Foldal . [ Unconsciously folding his hands . ] Do you say that in sober earnest ?
Borkman . [ Dismissing the subject , without answering . ] We are only wasting each other's time .
You had better not come here again .
Foldal . Then you really want me to leave you ?
Borkman . [ Without looking at him . ] I have no=longer any use for you .
Foldal . [ Softly , taking his portfolio .
] No , no , no ; I daresay not .
Borkman . Here you have been lying to me all=the=time .
Foldal . [ Shaking his head . ] Never lying , John=Gabriel .
Borkman . Have you not sat here feeding me with hope , and trust , and confidence -- that was all a lie ?
Foldal . It was_ _n't a lie so long as you believed in my vocation .
So long as you believed in me , I believed in you . Borkman .
Then we have been all=the=time deceiving each=other .
And perhaps deceiving ourselves -- both of us .
Foldal . But is_ _n't that just the essence of friendship , John=Gabriel ?
Borkman . [ Smiling bitterly . ] Yes , you are right there .
Friendship means -- deception .
I have learnt that once before .
Foldal . [ Looking at him . ] I have no poetic vocation !
And you could actually say it to me so bluntly .
Perhaps you know more=than you think .
Borkman . I ?
Foldal . [ Softly . ] Yes , you .
For I myself have had my doubts , now and then , I may tell you .
The horrible doubt that I may have bungled my life for=the=sake=of a delusion . Borkman .
If you have no faith in yourself , you are on the downward path indeed .
Foldal . That was why I found such comfort in coming here to lean upon your faith in me . [ Taking his hat .
] But now you have become a stranger to me .
Borkman . And you to me .
Foldal . Good-night , John=Gabriel .
Borkman .
Good-night , Vilhelm . [ Foldal goes out to the left .
[ Borkman stands for a moment gazing at the closed-door ;
makes a movement as=though to call Foldal back , but changes his mind , and begins to pace the floor with his hands behind his back .
Then he stops at the table beside the sofa and puts out the lamp .
The room becomes half-dark .
After a short pause , there comes a knock at the tapestry door .
Borkman . [ At the table , starts , turns , and asks in a loud voice : ] Who is that knocking ? [ No answer , another knock .
Borkman . [ Without moving .
] Who is it ?
Come in !
[ ELLA Rentheim , with a lighted candle in her hand , appears in the doorway .
She wears her black dress , as before , with her cloak thrown loosely round her shoulders .
Borkman . [ Staring at her . ] Who are you ?
What do you want with me ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Closes the door and advances . ] It is I , Borkman .
Borkman . [ Stands as=though thunderstruck , stares fixedly at her , and says in a half-whisper . ] Is it -- is it Ella ?
Is it Ella=Rentheim ?
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , it_ _s « your » Ella , as you used to call me in the old days ;
many , many years ago . Borkman . [ As before .
] Yes , it is you Ella , I can see you now .
Ella=rentheim . Can you recognise me ?
Borkman . Yes , now I begin to ----
Ella=rentheim . The years have told on me , and brought winter with them , Borkman .
Do you not think so ?
Borkman . [ In a forced voice .
] You are a good deal changed -- just at=first glance .
Ella=rentheim .
There are no dark curls on my neck now -- the curls you once loved to twist round your fingers .
Borkman . [ Quickly . ] True !
I can see now , Ella , you have done your hair differently .
Ella=rentheim . [ With a sad smile .
] Precisely ; it is the way I do my hair that makes the difference .
Borkman . [ Changing the subject .
] I had no idea that you were in this part of the world .
Ella=rentheim . I have only just arrived .
Borkman . Why have you come all this way now , in winter ?
Ella=rentheim . That you shall hear .
Borkman . Is it me you have come to see ?
Ella=rentheim . You among others .
But if I am to tell you my errand , I must begin far=back .
Borkman . You look tired .
Ella=rentheim . Yes , I am tired .
Borkman . Will_ _n't you sit down ?
There on the sofa .
Ella=rentheim . Yes , thank you ;
I need rest .
[ She crosses to the right and seats herself in the furthest forward corner of the sofa .
Borkman stands beside the table with his hands behind his back looking at her .
A short silence .
Ella=rentheim . It seems an endless time since we two met , Borkman , face to face .
Borkman . [ Gloomily . ] It is a long , long-time .
And terrible things have passed since=then .
Ella=rentheim .
A whole lifetime has passed -- a wasted lifetime .
Borkman . [ Looking keenly at her . ] Wasted !
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , I say wasted -- for both of us .
Borkman . [ In a cold business tone . ] I can_ _not regard my life as wasted yet .
Ella=rentheim . And what about mine ?
Borkman . There you have yourself to blame , Ella .
Ella=rentheim . [ With a start . ] And you can say that ? Borkman .
You could quite well have been happy without me .
Ella=rentheim . Do you believe that ?
Borkman . If you had made up your mind to .
Ella=rentheim . [ Bitterly . ] Oh , yes , I know well enough there was some one else ready to marry me .
Borkman . But you rejected him .
Ella=rentheim . Yes , I did .
Borkman . Time after time you rejected him .
Year=after=year ----
You might perfectly well have been happy with him .
And then I should have been saved .
Ella=rentheim . You ?
Borkman . Yes , you would have saved me , Ella .
Ella=rentheim . How do you mean ?
Borkman . He thought I was at the bottom of your obstinacy -- of your perpetual refusals .
And then he took his revenge .
It was so easy for him ; he had all my frank , confiding letters in his keeping . He made his own use of them ;
and then it was all=over with me -- for the time , that is to say .
So you see it is all your doing , Ella !
Ella=rentheim . Oh indeed , Borkman . If we look into the matter , it appears that it is I who owe you reparation .
Borkman . It depends how you look at it .
I know quite well all that you have done for us .
You bought in this house , and the whole property , at the auction .
You placed the house entirely at my disposal -- and your sister too .
You took charge of Erhart , and cared for him in every way ----
Ella=rentheim . As=long=as I was allowed to ----
Borkman . By your sister , you mean .
I have never mixed myself up in these domestic affairs .
As I was saying , I know all the sacrifices you have made for me and for your sister .
But you were in a position to do so , Ella ;
and you must not forget that it was I who placed you in that position .
Ella=rentheim . [ Indignantly . ] There you make a great mistake , Borkman !
It was the love of my inmost heart for Erhart -- and for you too -- that made me do it ! Borkman . [ Interrupting .
] My dear Ella , do not let us get upon questions of sentiment and that sort of thing .
I mean , of=course , that if you acted generously , it was I that put it in your power to do so .
Ella=rentheim . [ Smiling . ] H'm ! In my power ----
Borkman . [ Warmly . ] Yes , put it in your power , I say !
On the eve of the great decisive battle -- when I could not afford to spare either kith or kin -- when I had to grasp at -- when I did grasp at the millions that were entrusted to me -- then I spared all that was yours , every farthing , although I could have taken it , and made use of it , as I did of all the rest !
Ella=rentheim . [ Coldly and quietly . ] That is quite true , Borkman .
Borkman . Yes it is .
And that was why , when they came and took me , they found all your securities untouched in the strong-room of the bank .
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking at him . ] I have often and often wondered what was your real reason for sparing all my property ?
That , and that alone .
Borkman . My reason ?
Ella=rentheim . Yes , your reason .
Tell me .
Borkman . [ Harshly and scornfully . ] Perhaps you think it was that I might have something to fall back upon , if things went wrong ?
Ella=rentheim . Oh no , I am sure you did not think of that in those days .
Borkman . Never !
I was so absolutely certain of victory .
Ella=rentheim . Well then , why was it that ---- ?
Borkman . [ Shrugging his shoulders . ] Upon my soul , Ella , it is not so easy to remember one's motives of twenty years ago .
I only know that when I used to grapple , silently and alone , with all the great projects I had in my mind , I had something like the feeling of a man who is starting on a balloon voyage .
All through my sleepless nights I was inflating my giant balloon , and preparing to soar away into perilous , unknown regions .
Ella=rentheim . [ Smiling . ] You , who never had the least doubt of victory ?
Borkman . [ Impatiently . ] Men are made so , Ella .
They both doubt and believe at the same time . [ Looking straight before him .
] And I suppose that was why I would not take you and yours with me in the balloon .
Ella=rentheim . [ Eagerly .
] Why , I ask you ?
Tell me why ! Borkman . [ Without looking at her .
] One shrinks from risking what one holds dearest on such a voyage . Ella=rentheim .
You had risked what was dearest to you on that voyage . Your whole future life ----
Borkman . Life is not always what one holds dearest .
Ella=rentheim . [ Breathlessly .
] Was that how you felt at that time ? Borkman .
I fancy it was . Ella=rentheim . I was the dearest thing in the world to you ? Borkman .
I seem to remember something of the sort .
Ella=rentheim . And yet years had passed since you had deserted me -- and married -- married another !
Borkman . Deserted you , you say ?
You must know very well that it was higher motives -- well then , other motives that compelled me .
Without his support I could not have done anything .
Ella=rentheim . [ Controlling herself . ] So you deserted me from -- higher motives .
Borkman . I could not get on without his help .
And he made you the price of helping me .
Ella=rentheim .
And you paid the price .
Paid it in full -- without haggling .
Borkman . I had no choice .
I had to conquer or fall .
Both then and afterwards -- long , long , after .
Ella=rentheim . But you bartered me away none=the=less ;
drove a bargain with another man for your love .
Sold my love for a -- for a directorship .
Borkman . [ Gloomily and bowed down . ] I was driven by inexorable necessity , Ella .
Ella=rentheim . [ Rises from the sofa , quivering with passion .
] Criminal ! Borkman . [ Starts , but controls himself .
] I have heard that word before . Ella=rentheim . Oh , do_ _n't imagine I_ _m thinking of anything you may have done against the law of the land !
The use you made of all those vouchers and securities , or whatever you call them -- do you think I care a straw about that !
If=I could have stood at your side when the crash came ---- Borkman . [ Eagerly .
] What then , Ella ? Ella=rentheim .
Trust me , I should have borne it all so gladly along=with you .
The shame , the ruin -- I would have helped you to bear it all -- all !
Borkman .
Would you have had the will -- the strength ?
Ella=rentheim . Both the will and the strength .
For then I did not know of your great , your terrible crime .
Borkman . What crime ?
What are you speaking of ? Ella=rentheim .
I am speaking of that crime for which there is no forgiveness .
Borkman . [ Staring at her . ] You must be out=of your mind .
Ella=rentheim . [ Approaching him . ] You are a murderer !
You have committed the one mortal sin !
Borkman . [ Falling back towards the piano . ] You are raving , Ella !
Ella=rentheim . You have killed the love-life in me . [ Still nearer him .
] Do you understand what that means ?
The=Bible speaks of a mysterious sin for which there is no forgiveness .
I have never understood what it could be ;
but now I understand .
The great , unpardonable sin is to murder the love-life in a human soul .
Borkman . And you say I have done that ?
Ella=rentheim . You have done that .
I have never rightly understood until this evening what had really happened to me .
That you deserted me and turned to Gunhild instead -- I took that to be mere common fickleness on your part , and the result of heartless scheming on hers .
I almost think I despised you a little , in=spite=of everything .
But now I see it !
You deserted the woman you loved !
Me , me , me !
What you held dearest in the world you were ready to barter away for gain .
That is the double murder you have committed !
The murder of your own soul and of mine !
Borkman . [ With cold self-control . ] How well I recognise your passionate , ungovernable spirit , Ella .
No doubt it is natural enough that you should look at the thing in this light .
Of=course , you are a woman , and therefore it would seem that your own heart is the one thing you know or care about in this world .
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , yes it is . Borkman .
Your own heart is the only thing that exists for you . Ella=rentheim .
The only thing !
The only thing !
You are right there . Borkman . But you must remember that I am a man .
As a woman , you were the dearest thing in the world to me .
But if the worst comes to the worst , one-woman can always take the place of another .
Ella=rentheim . [ Looks at him with a smile . ] Was that your experience when you had made Gunhild your wife ?
Borkman .
No. But the great aims I had in life helped me to bear even that .
I wanted to have at my command all the sources of power in this country .
All the wealth that lay hidden in the soil , and the rocks , and the forests , and the sea -- I wanted to gather it all into my hands to make myself master of it all , and so to promote the well-being of many , many thousands .
Ella=rentheim . [ Lost in recollection . ] I know it .
Think of all the evenings we spent in talking over your projects .
Borkman . Yes , I could talk to you , Ella .
Ella=rentheim . I jested with your plans , and asked whether you wanted to awaken all the sleeping spirits of the mine .
Borkman . [ Nodding .
] I remember that phrase . [ Slowly . ] All the sleeping spirits of the mine .
Ella=rentheim . But you did not take it as a jest .
You said : " Yes , yes , Ella , that is just what I want to do .
"
Borkman . And so it was .
If only I could get my foot in the stirrup ---- And that depended on that one-man .
He could and would secure me the control of the bank -- if I on my side ----
Ella=rentheim . Yes , just=so !
If you on your side would renounce the woman you loved -- and who loved you beyond words in=return .
Borkman . I knew his consuming passion for you .
I knew that on no other condition would he ----
Ella=rentheim . And so you struck the bargain .
Borkman . [ Vehemently . ] Yes , I did , Ella !
For the love of power is uncontrollable in me , you see !
So=I struck the bargain ;
I had to .
And he helped me half-way up towards the beckoning heights that I was bent on reaching .
And I mounted and mounted ;
year by year I mounted ----
Ella=rentheim . And I was as=though wiped out=of your life .
Borkman . And after all he hurled me into the abyss again .
On=account=of you , Ella .
Ella=rentheim . [ After a short thoughtful silence . ] Borkman , does it not seem to you as=if there had been a sort of curse on our whole relation ?
Borkman . [ Looking at her . ] A curse ?
Ella=rentheim . Yes .
Do_ _n't you think so ?
Borkman . [ Uneasily . ] Yes .
But why is it ? [ With an outburst .
] Oh=Ella , I begin to wonder which is in the right -- you or I !
Ella=rentheim . It is you who have sinned .
You have done to death all the gladness of my life in me .
Borkman . [ Anxiously . ] Do not say that , Ella !
Ella=rentheim . All a woman's gladness at=any=rate .
From the day when your image began to dwindle in my mind , I have lived my life as=though under an eclipse .
During all these years it has grown harder and harder for me -- and at=last utterly impossible -- to love any living creature .
Human beings , animals , plants : I shrank from all -- from all=but one ----
Borkman . What one ?
Ella=rentheim .
Erhart , of=course .
Borkman . Erhart ?
Ella=rentheim . Erhart -- your son , Borkman .
Borkman . Has he really been so close to your heart ?
Ella=rentheim .
Why else should I have taken him to me , and kept him as=long=as ever I could ?
Why ?
Borkman . I thought it was out=of pity , like all the rest that you did .
Ella=rentheim . [ In strong inward emotion . ] Pity !
Ha , ha !
I have never known pity , since you deserted me .
I was incapable of feeling it .
If a poor starved child came into my kitchen , shivering , and crying , and begging for a morsel of food , I let the servants look to it .
I never felt any desire to take the child to myself , to warm it at my own hearth , to have the pleasure of seeing it eat and be satisfied .
And yet I was not like that when I was young ;
that I remember clearly !
Except only for Erhart .
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , except=for your son .
But I am hardened to every other living thing .
You have cheated me of a mother's joy and happiness in life -- and of a mother's sorrows and tears as=well .
And perhaps that is the heaviest part of the loss to me .
Borkman . Do you say that , Ella ?
Ella=rentheim . Who knows ?
It may be that a mother's sorrows and tears were what I needed most . [ With still deeper emotion .
] But at that time I could not resign myself to my loss ;
and that was why I took Erhart to me .
I won him entirely .
Until what ?
Ella=rentheim .
Until his mother -- his mother in the flesh , I mean -- took him from me again .
Borkman .
He had to leave you in any case ;
he had to come to town . Ella=rentheim . [ Wringing her hands . ] Yes , but I can_ _not bear the solitude -- the emptiness !
I can_ _not bear the loss of your son's heart !
Borkman . [ With an evil expression in his eyes .
] H'm -- I doubt whether you have lost it , Ella .
Hearts are not so easily lost to a certain person -- in the room below .
Ella=rentheim .
I have lost Erhart here , and she has won him back again .
Or if=not she , some one else .
That is plain enough in the letters he writes me from time to time .
Borkman . Then it is to take him back with you that you have come here ?
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , if only it were possible ---- ! Borkman .
It is possible enough , if you have set your heart upon it . For you have the first and strongest claims upon him .
Ella=rentheim . Oh , claims , claims !
What is the use of claims ?
If he is not mine of his own free will , he is not mine at=all .
And have him I must !
I must have my boy's heart , whole and undivided -- now !
Borkman . You must remember that Erhart is well into his twenties .
You could scarcely reckon on keeping his heart very long undivided , as you express it .
Ella=rentheim . [ With a melancholy smile . ] It would not need to be for so very long .
Borkman . Indeed ?
I should have thought that when you want a thing , you want it to the end of your days .
Ella=rentheim . So I do .
But that need not mean for very long .
Borkman . [ Taken aback . ] What do you mean by that ?
Ella=rentheim . I suppose you know I have been in bad health for many years past ?
Borkman .
Have you ? Ella=rentheim .
Do you not know that ?
Borkman . No , I can_ _not say I did ---- Ella=rentheim . [ Looking at him in surprise . ] Has=Erhart not told you so ?
Borkman . I really do_ _n't remember at the moment .
Ella=rentheim . Perhaps he has not spoken of me at=all ?
Borkman . Oh , yes , I believe he has spoken of you .
But the fact is , I so seldom see anything of him -- scarcely ever .
There is a certain person below that keeps him away from me .
Keeps him away , you understand ?
Ella=rentheim . Are you quite sure of that , Borkman ?
Borkman . Yes , absolutely sure . [ Changing his tone .
] And so you have been in bad health , Ella ? Ella=rentheim .
Yes , I have .
And you have seen the doctors already ?
Ella=rentheim . Yes , this morning .
Borkman . And what did they say to you ?
Ella=rentheim . They gave me full assurance of what I had long suspected .
Borkman .
Well ? Ella=rentheim . [ Calmly and quietly . ] My illness will never be cured , Borkman . Borkman .
Oh , you must not believe that , Ella .
Ella=rentheim . It is a disease that there is no help or cure for .
The doctors can do nothing with it .
They must just let it take its course .
They can_ _not possibly check it ;
at=most , they can allay the suffering .
And that is always something .
Borkman . Oh , but it will take a long time to run its course .
I am sure it will . Ella=rentheim . I may perhaps last out the winter , they told me .
Borkman . [ Without thinking . ] Oh , well , the winter is long .
Ella=rentheim . [ Quietly . ] Long enough for me , at=any=rate .
Borkman . [ Eagerly , changing the subject . ] But what in all the world can have brought on this illness ?
You , who have always lived such a healthy and regular life ?
What can have brought it on ?
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking at him . ] The doctors thought that perhaps at one-time in my life I had had to go through some great stress of emotion .
Borkman . [ Firing up . ] Emotion !
Aha , I understand !
You mean that it is my fault ?
Ella=rentheim . [ With increasing inward agitation . ] It is too late to go into that matter now !
But=I must have my heart's own child again before I go !
It is so unspeakably sad for me to think that I must go away from all that is called life -- away from sun , and light , and air -- and not leave behind me one single human being who will think of me -- who will remember me lovingly and mournfully -- as a son remembers and thinks of the mother he has lost .
Borkman . [ After a short pause . ] Take him , Ella , if you can win him .
Ella=rentheim . [ With animation . ] Do you give your consent ?
Can you ?
Borkman . [ Gloomily .
] Yes . And it is no great sacrifice either .
For in any case he is not mine .
Ella=rentheim .
Thank you , thank you all=the=same for the sacrifice !
But=I have one thing more to beg of you -- a great thing for me , Borkman . Borkman .
Well , what is it ?
Ella=rentheim . I daresay you will think it childish of me -- you will not understand ----
Borkman . Go on -- tell me what it is .
Ella=rentheim . When I die -- as I must soon -- I shall have a fair amount to leave behind me .
Borkman . Yes , I suppose so .
Ella=rentheim . And I intend to leave it all to Erhart . Borkman .
Well , you have really no=one nearer to you than he .
Ella=rentheim . [ Warmly . ] No , indeed , I have no=one nearer me than he .
Borkman . No=one of your own family .
You are the last .
Ella=rentheim . [ Nodding slowly . ] Yes , that is just it .
When I die , the name of Rentheim dies with me .
And that is such a torturing thought to me .
To be wiped out=of existence -- even to your very name ----
Borkman . [ Firing up . ] Ah , I see what you are driving at !
Ella=rentheim . [ Passionately . ] Do not let this be my forte .
Let Erhart bear my name after me !
Borkman . I understand you well enough .
You want to save my son from having to bear his father's name .
That is your meaning .
Ella=rentheim . No , no , not that !
I myself would have borne it proudly and gladly along=with you !
But a mother who is at the point of death ---- There is more binding force in a name than you think or believe , Borkman .
Borkman . [ Coldly and proudly .
] Well and good , Ella .
I am man enough to bear my own name alone .
Ella=rentheim . [ Seizing and pressing his hand . ] Thank you , thank you !
Now there has been a full settlement between us !
Yes , yes , let it be so !
You have made all the atonement in your power .
For when I have gone from the world , I shall leave Erhart=Rentheim behind me !
[ The tapestry door is thrown open .
Mrs . Borkman , with the large shawl over her head , stands in the doorway .
Mrs .
Borkman . [ In violent agitation . ] Never to his dying day shall Erhart be called by that name !
Ella=rentheim . [ Shrinking back . ] Gunhild !
Borkman . [ Advancing a step . ] I do not ask your permission . Borkman . [ Going towards her .
] What do you want with me ? Mrs .
Borkman . I will fight with all my might for you .
I will protect you from the powers of evil .
Ella=rentheim . The worst « powers of evil » are in yourself , Gunhild !
Mrs . Borkman . [ Harshly .
] So be it then . [ Menacingly , with upstretched arm. ] But this I tell you -- he shall bear his father's name !
And bear it aloft in honour again !
My son's heart shall be mine -- mine and no other's .
[ She goes out by the tapestry door and shuts it behind her .
Ella=rentheim . [ Shaken and shattered .
] Borkman , Erhart's life will be wrecked in this storm .
There must be an understanding between you and Gunhild .
We must go down to her at=once .
Borkman . [ Looking at her .
] We ? I too , do you mean ?
Ella=rentheim . Both you and I .
Borkman . [ Shaking his head . ] She is hard , I tell you .
Hard as the metal I once dreamed of hewing out=of the rocks .
Ella=rentheim . Then try it now !
[ Borkman does not answer , but stands looking doubtfully at her .
Act Third
Mrs .
BORKMAN's drawing room .
The lamp is still burning on the table beside the sofa in=front .
The garden-room at the back is quite dark .
Mrs .
Borkman , with the shawl still over her head , enters , in violent agitation , by the hall door , goes up=to the window , draws the curtain a little aside , and looks out ;
then she seats herself beside the stove , but immediately springs up again , goes to the bell-pull and rings .
Stands beside the sofa , and waits a moment .
No=one comes .
The Maid presently enters from the hall .
She looks sleepy and out=of temper , and appears to have dressed in great haste .
Mrs .
Borkman . [ Impatiently . ] What has become of you , Malena ?
I have rung for you twice !
The Maid . Yes , ma'am , I heard you . Mrs .
Borkman . And yet you did_ _n't come ?
The Maid . [ Sulkily . ] I had to put some clothes on first , I suppose . Mrs . Borkman . Yes , you must dress yourself properly , and then you must run and fetch my son . The Maid . [ Looking at her in astonishment . ] You want me to fetch Mr. Erhart ? Mrs .
Borkman . Yes ;
tell him he must come home to me at=once ;
I want to speak to him .
The Maid . [ Grumbling .
] Then=I_ _d better go to the bailiff's and call up the coachman .
Why ? The Maid .
To get him to harness the sledge .
The snow's dreadful to-night . Mrs .
Borkman . Oh , that does_ _n't matter ;
only make haste and go .
It_ _s just round the corner . The Maid .
Why , ma'am you can_ _n't call that just round the corner ! Mrs .
Borkman . Of=course it is .
Do_ _n't you know Mr.=Hinkel's villa ?
The Maid . [ With malice . ] Oh , indeed ! It_ _s there Mr.=Erhart is this evening ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ Taken aback . ] Why , where else should he be ?
The Maid . [ With a slight smile . ] Well , I only thought he might be where he usually is .
Mrs . Borkman . Where do you mean ?
The Maid . At Mrs.=Wilton's , as they call her .
Mrs . Borkman . Mrs.=Wilton's ?
My son is_ _n't so often there .
The Maid . [ Half muttering . ] I_ _ve heard say as he_ _s there every day of his life . Mrs .
Borkman . That's all nonsense , Malena .
Go straight to Mr.=Hinkel's and try to to get hold of him .
The Maid . [ With a toss of her head .
] Oh , very well ;
I_ _m going .
[ She is on the point of going out by the hall , but just at that moment the hall door is opened , and Ella=rentheim and Borkman appear on the threshold .
Mrs . Borkman . [ Staggers a step backwards .
] What does this mean ?
The Maid . [ Terrified , instinctively folding her hands . ] Lord save us !
Mrs . Borkman . [ Whispers to The Maid . ] Tell him he must come this instant .
The Maid . [ Softly . ] Yes , ma'am .
[ ELLA Rentheim and , after her , Borkman enter the room .
The Maid sidles behind them to the door , goes out , and closes it after her .
Mrs .
] What does he want down here in my room ?
Ella=rentheim . He wants to come to an understanding with you , Gunhild . Mrs .
Borkman . He has never tried that before .
Ella=rentheim . He is going to , this evening . Mrs .
Borkman . The last time we stood face to face -- it was in the Court , when I was summoned to give an account ----
Borkman . [ Approaching .
] And this evening it is _I_ who will give an account of myself . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looking at him . ] You ?
Borkman . Not of what I have done amiss .
All the world knows that . Mrs .
Borkman . [ With a bitter sigh . ] Yes , that is true ;
all the world knows that .
Borkman . But it does not know why I did it ;
why I had to do it .
People do not understand that I had to , because I was myself -- because I was John=Gabriel=Borkman -- myself , and not another .
And that is what I will try to explain to you . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Shaking her head . ] It is of no use .
Temptations and promptings acquit no=one .
Borkman . They may acquit one in one's own eyes .
Mrs . Borkman . [ With a gesture of repulsion .
] Oh , let all that alone !
I have thought over that black business of yours enough and to spare .
Borkman . I too .
During those five endless years in my cell -- and elsewhere -- I had time to think it over .
And during the eight years up there in the gallery I have had still more ample time .
I have re-tried the whole case -- by myself .
Time after time I have re-tried it .
I have been my own accuser , my own defender , and my own judge .
I have been more impartial than any one else could be -- that I venture to say .
I have paced up=and=down the gallery there , turning every one of my actions upside down and inside out .
I have examined them from all sides as unsparingly , as pitilessly , as any lawyer of them all .
Borkman . And what about me ?
What about your son ?
Borkman . And what about the hundreds of others , then -- the people you are said to have ruined ?
Borkman . [ More vehemently .
] I had power in my hands !
And then I felt the irresistible vocation within me !
The prisoned millions lay all=over the country , deep in the bowels of the earth , calling aloud to me !
They shrieked to me to free them !
But no=one else heard their cry -- I alone had ears for it . Mrs .
Borkman .
Yes , to the branding of the name of Borkman . Borkman .
Borkman . No=one , no=one but you would have done it !
Borkman . Perhaps not .
But that would have been because they had not my brains .
And if they had done it , it would not have been with my aims in view .
The act would have been a different act .
In short , I have acquitted myself .
Ella=rentheim . [ Softly and appealingly . ] Oh , can you say that so confidently , Borkman ?
Borkman . [ Nodding . ] Acquitted myself on that score .
But then comes the great , crushing self-accusation .
Mrs . Borkman . What is that ?
Borkman . I have skulked up there and wasted eight precious years of my life !
The very day I was set free , I should have gone forth into the world -- out into the steel-hard , dreamless world of reality !
Borkman . Oh , it would have been the same thing over again ; take my word for that .
Borkman . [ Shakes his head , and looks at her with a sententious air .
] It is true that nothing new happens ; but what has happened does not repeat itself either .
It is the eye that transforms the action .
The eye , born anew , transforms the old action . [ Breaking off .
] But you do not understand this . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Curtly . ] No , I do not understand it .
Borkman . Ah , that is just the curse -- I have never found one single soul to understand me .
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking at him . ] Never , Borkman ?
Borkman . Except one -- perhaps .
Long , long-ago .
In the days when I did not think I needed understanding .
Since=then , at=any=rate , no one has understood me !
There has been no=one alive enough to my needs to be afoot and rouse me -- to ring the morning bell for me -- to call me up=to manful work anew .
And to impress upon me that I had done nothing inexpiable . Mrs .
Borkman . [ With a scornful laugh . ] So , after all , you require to have that impressed on you from=without ?
Borkman . [ With increasing indignation . ] Yes , when the whole world hisses in chorus that I have sunk never to rise again , there come moments when I almost believe it myself . [ Raising his head .
] But then my inmost assurance rises again triumphant ;
and that acquits me .
What use would it have been to come to you ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ With a gesture of repulsion . ] You have never loved anything outside yourself ;
that is the secret of the whole matter . Borkman . [ Proudly .
] I have loved power . Mrs . Borkman .
Yes , power ! Borkman . The power to create human happiness in wide , wide circles around me ! Mrs .
Borkman . You had once the power to make me happy .
Have you used it to that end ?
Borkman . [ Without looking at her . ] Some one must generally go down in a shipwreck . Mrs .
Borkman . And your own son !
Have you used your power -- have you lived and laboured -- to make him happy ? Borkman . I do not know him .
Mrs . Borkman .
No , that is true .
You do not even know him .
Borkman . [ Harshly . ] You , his mother , have taken care of that ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looking at him with a lofty air .
] Oh , you do not know what I have taken care of ! Borkman . You ? Mrs .
Borkman .
Yes , I .
I alone .
Borkman . Then tell me . Mrs . Borkman .
I have taken care of your memory .
Borkman . [ With a short dry laugh . ] My memory ?
Oh , indeed !
It sounds almost as=if I were dead already .
Mrs . Borkman . [ With emphasis . ] And so you are .
Borkman . [ Slowly . ] Yes , perhaps you are right . [ Firing up .
] But no , no !
Not=yet !
I have been close to the verge of death .
But now I have awakened .
I have come to myself .
A whole life lies before me yet .
Borkman . [ Raising her hand . ] Never dream of life again !
Lie quiet where you are .
Ella=rentheim . [ Shocked . ] Gunhild !
Gunhild , how can you ---- ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Not listening to her . ] I will raise the monument over your grave .
Borkman . The pillar of shame , I suppose you mean ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ With increasing excitement . ] Oh , no , it shall be no pillar of metal or stone .
And no=one shall be suffered to carve any scornful legend on the monument I shall raise .
There shall be , as it were , a quickset hedge of trees and bushes , close , close around your tomb .
They shall hide away all the darkness that has been .
The eyes of men and the thoughts of men shall no longer dwell on John=Gabriel=Borkman !
Borkman . [ Hoarsely and cuttingly . ] And this labour of love you will perform ? Mrs .
Borkman . Not by my own strength .
I can_ _not think of that .
But I have brought up one to help me , who shall live for this alone .
His life shall be so pure and high and bright , that your burrowing in the dark shall be as=though it had never been !
Borkman . [ Darkly and threateningly . ] If it is Erhart you mean , say so at=once ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looking him straight in the eyes . ] Yes , it is Erhart ;
my son ;
he whom you are ready to renounce in atonement for your own acts .
Borkman . [ With a look towards ELLA . ] In atonement for my blackest sin . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Repelling the idea . ] A sin towards a stranger only .
Remember the sin towards me ! [ Looking triumphantly at them both .
] But he will not obey you !
When=I cry out to him in my need , he will come to me !
It is with me that he will remain !
With me , and never with any one else . [ Suddenly listens , and cries .
] I hear him ! He is here , he is here !
Erhart !
[ Erhart Borkman hastily tears open the hall door , and enters the room .
Erhart . [ Pale and anxious . ] Mother !
What in Heaven's name ---- ! [ Seeing Borkman , who is standing beside the doorway leading into the garden-room , he starts and takes off his hat .
After a moment's silence , he asks : ] What do you want with me , mother ?
What has happened ?
Mrs . Borkman . [ Stretching her arms towards him . ] I want to see you , Erhart !
I want to have you with me , always !
Erhart . [ Stammering . ] Have me ---- ?
Always ?
What do you mean by that ?
Mrs . Borkman . I will have you , I say !
There is some one who wants to take you away from me !
Erhart . [ Recoiling a step . ] Ah -- so you know ? Mrs .
Borkman . Yes .
Do you know it , too ?
Erhart . [ Surprised , looking at her . ] Do _I_ know it ?
Yes , of=course . Mrs .
Borkman . Aha , so you have planned it all-out !
Behind my back !
Erhart ! Erhart !
Erhart . [ Quickly . ] Mother , tell me what it is you know ! Mrs .
Borkman . I know everything .
I know that your aunt has come here to take you from me .
Erhart . Aunt Ella !
Ella=rentheim . Oh , listen to me a moment , Erhart ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Continuing . ] She wants me to give you up=to her .
She wants to stand in your mother's place to you , Erhart !
She wants you to be her son , and not mine , from this time forward .
She wants you to inherit everything from her ;
to renounce your own name and take hers instead !
Erhart . Aunt Ella , is this true ?
Ella=rentheim . Yes , it is true .
Erhart . I knew nothing of this .
Why do you want to have me with you again ?
Ella=rentheim . Because I feel that I am losing you here . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Hardly . ] You are losing him to me -- yes .
And that is just as it should be .
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking beseechingly at him . ] Erhart , I can_ _not afford to lose you .
For , I must tell you I am a lonely -- dying woman .
Erhart . Dying ---- ?
Ella=rentheim . Yes , dying .
Will you came and be with me to the end ?
Attach yourself wholly to me ?
Be to me , as=though you were my own child ---- ?
Mrs . Borkman . [ Interrupting . ] And forsake your mother , and perhaps your mission in life as=well ?
Will you , Erhart ?
Ella=rentheim . I am condemned to death .
Answer me , Erhart .
Erhart . [ Warmly , with emotion .
] Aunt=Ella , you have been unspeakably good to me .
Borkman . Erhart , Erhart !
Ella=rentheim . Oh , how glad I am that you can still say that ! Erhart .
But I can_ _not sacrifice myself to you now .
It is not possible for me to devote myself wholly to taking a son's place towards you . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Triumphing . ] Ah , I knew it !
You shall not have him !
You shall not have him , Ella !
Ella=rentheim . [ Sadly . ] I see it .
You have won him back .
Mrs . Borkman . Yes , yes ! Mine he is , and mine he shall remain ! Erhart , say it is so , dear ;
we two have still a long way to go together , have we not ? Erhart . [ Struggling with himself .
Borkman . [ Eagerly . ] What ? Erhart .
I am afraid it is only a very little way you and I can go together . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Stands as=though thunderstruck . ] What do yo mean by that ?
Erhart . [ Plucking up spirit . ] Good=heavens , mother , I am young , after all !
I feel as=if the close air of this room must stifle me in the end . Mrs .
Borkman . Close air ? Here -- with me ?
Erhart . Yes , here with you , mother .
Ella=rentheim . Then come with me , Erhart .
Erhart . Oh , Aunt=Ella , it_ _s not a whit better with you .
It_ _s different , but no better -- no better for me . It smells of rose-leaves and lavender there too ;
it is as airless there as here .
Mrs .
Borkman . [ Shaken , but having recovered her composure with an effort .
] Airless in your mother's room , you say ! Erhart . [ In growing impatience .
] Yes , I do_ _n't know how else to express it .
All this morbid watchfulness and -- and idolisation , or whatever you like to call it ---- I can_ _n't endure it any longer ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looking at him with deep solemnity .
] Have you forgotten what you have consecrated your life to , Erhart ? Erhart . [ With an outburst .
] Oh , say rather what you have consecrated my life to .
You , you have been my will .
You have never given me leave to have any of my own .
But now I can_ _not bear this yoke any longer .
I am young ;
remember that , mother . [ With a polite , considerate glance towards Borkman .
Borkman . [ Seized with growing anxiety .
] Who is it that has transformed you , Erhart ?
Erhart . [ Struck . ] Who ?
Can you not conceive that it is I myself ? Mrs .
Borkman . No , no , no !
You have come under some strange power .
You are not in your mother's power any longer ;
nor in your -- your foster-mother's either .
Erhart . [ With laboured defiance . ] I am in my own power , mother !
And working my own will !
Borkman . [ Advancing towards Erhart . ] Then perhaps my hour has come at last .
Erhart . [ Distantly and with measured politeness . ] How so !
How do you mean , sir ?
Mrs . Borkman . [ Scornfully . ] Yes , you may well ask that .
Borkman . [ Continuing undisturbed . ] Listen , Erhart -- will you not cast in your lot with your father ?
It is not through any other man's life that a man who has fallen can be raised up again .
These are only empty fables that have been told to you down here in the airless room .
If you were to set yourself to live your life like all the saints together , it would be of no use whatever to me .
Erhart . [ With measured respectfulness .
] That is very true indeed .
Borkman . Yes , it is .
And it would be of no use either if I should resign myself to wither away in abject penitence .
I have tried to feed myself upon hopes and dreams , all through these years .
But I am not the man to be content with that ;
and now I mean to have done with dreaming .
Erhart . [ With a slight bow . ] And what will -- what will you do , sir ? Borkman .
I will work=out my own redemption , that is what I will do .
I will begin at the bottom again .
It is only through his present and his future that a man can atone for his past .
Through work , indefatigable work , for=all=that , in my youth , seemed to give life its meaning -- and that now seems a thousand times greater than it did then .
Borkman . [ Raising her hand warningly . ] Do not do it , Erhart ! Ella=rentheim . [ Warmly .
] Yes , yes do it !
Oh , help him , Erhart ! Mrs .
Borkman . And you advise him to do that ?
You , the lonely dying woman .
Ella=rentheim . I do_ _n't care about myself . Mrs .
Borkman . No , so long as it is not I that take him from you .
Ella=rentheim . Precisely so , Gunhild .
Borkman .
Will you , Erhart ?
Erhart . [ Wrung with pain . ] Father , I can_ _not now .
It is utterly impossible !
Borkman . What do you want to do then ?
Erhart . [ With a sudden glow . ] I am young !
I want to live , for once in a way , as=well=as other people !
I want to live my own life !
Ella=rentheim . You can_ _not give up two or three little months to brighten the close of a poor waning life ?
Erhart . I can_ _not , Aunt , however much I may wish to .
Ella=rentheim .
Not for=the=sake=of one who loves you so dearly ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ Looking sharply at him . ] And your mother has no power over you either , any=more ? Erhart .
I will always love you , mother ;
but I can_ _not go on living for you alone .
This is no life for me . Borkman .
Then come and join with me , after all !
For life , life means work , Erhart .
Come , we two will go forth into life and work together !
Erhart . [ Passionately . ] Yes , but I do_ _n't want to work now !
For=I am young !
That's what I never realised before ;
but now the knowledge is tingling through every vein in my body .
I will not work !
I will only live , live , live !
Mrs . Borkman . [ With a cry of divination . ] Erhart , what will you live for ?
Erhart . [ With sparkling eyes . ] For happiness , mother ! Mrs .
Borkman . And where do you think you can find that ? Erhart .
I have found it , already !
Mrs . Borkman . [ Shrieks .
] Erhart ! [ Erhart goes quickly to the hall door and throws it open .
]
Erhart . [ Calls out . ] Fanny , you can come in now !
[ Mrs . Wilton , in outdoor wraps , appears on the threshold .
Mrs .
Borkman . [ With uplifted hands .
] Mrs.=Wilton ! Mrs .
Wilton . [ Hesitating a little , with an enquiring glance at Erhart . ] Do you want me to ---- ? Erhart .
Yes , now you can come in .
I have told them everything .
[ Mrs . Wilton comes forward into the room .
Erhart closes the door behind her .
A short pause .
Mrs .
Wilton . [ In a subdued but firm voice .
Borkman . [ Slowly , looking hard at her .
] You have crushed the last remnant of interest in life for me . [ With an outburst .
] But all of this -- all this is utterly impossible ! Mrs .
Wilton . I can quite understand that it must appear impossible to you , Mrs.=Borkman . Mrs .
Borkman . Yes , you can surely see for yourself that it is impossible .
Or what ---- ?
Mrs . Wilton . I should rather say that it seems highly improbable .
But it_ _s so , none=the=less . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Turning . ] Are you really in earnest about this , Erhart ? Erhart .
This means happiness for me , mother -- all the beauty and happiness of life .
That is all I can say to you . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Clenching her hands together ;
to Mrs . Wilton .
] Oh , how you have cajoled and deluded my unhappy son ! Mrs .
Wilton . [ Raising her head proudly . ] I have done nothing of the sort . Mrs .
Borkman . You have not , say you !
Mrs . Wilton .
No. I have neither cajoled nor deluded him .
Erhart came to me of his own free will .
And of my own free will I went out half-way to meet him . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Measuring her scornfully with her eye . ] Yes , indeed !
That=I can easily believe .
Borkman . What forces , may I ask ? Mrs . Wilton .
Wilton . [ Shortly . ] That other has deserted me . Mrs .
Borkman . But he is still living , they say . Mrs . Wilton .
He is dead to me . Erhart . [ Insistently .
] Yes , mother , he is dead to Fanny .
And besides , this other makes no difference to me !
Mrs . Borkman . [ Looking sternly at him . ] So you know all this -- about the other .
Erhart . Yes , mother , I know quite well -- all about it ! Mrs .
Borkman . And yet you can say that it makes no difference to you ?
Erhart . [ With defiant petulance . ] I can only tell you that it is happiness I must have !
I am young !
I want to live , live , live !
Mrs . Borkman . Yes , you are young , Erhart .
Too young for this .
Mrs . Wilton . [ Firmly and earnestly . ] You must not think , Mrs.=Borkman , that I have_ _n't said the same to him .
I have laid my whole life before him .
Again=and=again I have reminded him that I am seven years older than he ----
Erhart . [ Interrupting . ] Oh , nonsense , Fanny -- I knew that all=the=time . Mrs .
Wilton . But nothing -- nothing was of any use .
Mrs . Borkman . Indeed ?
Nothing ?
Then why did you not dismiss him without more ado ?
Close your door to him ?
You should have done that , and done it in time ! Mrs . Wilton . [ Looks at her , and says in a low voice .
Borkman . Why could you not ? Mrs .
Wilton . Because for me too this meant happiness . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Scornfully . ] H'm , happiness , happiness ---- Mrs .
Wilton . I have never before known happiness in life .
And I can_ _not possibly drive happiness away from me , merely because it comes so late . Mrs .
Borkman . And how long do you think this happiness will last ? Erhart . [ Interrupting .
] Whether it lasts or does not last , mother , it does_ _n't matter now ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ In anger . ] Blind boy that you are !
Do you not see where all this is leading you ?
Erhart . I do_ _n't want to look into the future .
I do_ _n't want to look around me in any direction ;
I am only determined to live my own life -- at=last ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ With deep pain . ] And you call this life , Erhart ! Erhart .
Do_ _n't you see how lovely she is ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Wringing her hands . ] And=I have to bear this load of shame as=well !
Borkman . [ At the back , harshly and cuttingly .
] Ho -- you are used to bearing things of that sort , Gunhild !
Ella=rentheim . [ Imploringly . ] Borkman !
Erhart . [ Similarly . ] Father ! Mrs . Borkman .
Day after day I shall have to see my own son linked to a -- a ---- Erhart . [ Interrupting her harshly .
] You shall see nothing of the kind , mother !
You may make your mind easy on that point .
I shall not remain here . Mrs .
Wilton . [ Quickly and with decision . ] We are going away , Mrs.=Borkman . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Turning pale . ] Are you going away , too ?
Together , no doubt ?
Mrs . Wilton . [ Nodding .
] Yes , I am going abroad , to the south .
I am taking a young girl with me .
And Erhart is going along=with us . Mrs .
Borkman . With you -- and a young girl ? Mrs .
Wilton . Yes .
It is little Frida=Foldal , whom I have had living with me .
I want her to go abroad and get more instruction in music . Mrs .
Borkman . So you are taking her with you ? Mrs .
Wilton . Yes ; I can_ _n't well send her out into the world alone . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Suppressing a smile . ] What do you say to this , Erhart ?
Erhart . [ With some embarrassment , shrugging his shoulders . ] Well , mother , since Fanny will have it so ----
Mrs . Borkman . [ Coldly . ] And when does this distinguished party set out , if one may ask ? Mrs .
Wilton . We are going at=once -- to-night .
My covered sledge is waiting on the road , outside the Hinkels' .
Wilton . [ Smiling . ] Yes , Erhart and I were the whole party .
And little Frida , of=course . Mrs .
Borkman . And where is she now ? Mrs .
Wilton . She is sitting in the sledge waiting for us .
Erhart . [ In painful embarrassment . ] Mother , surely you can understand ?
I would have spared you all this -- you and every one . Mrs . Borkman . [ Looks at him , deeply pained .
] You would have gone away from me without saying a good-bye ? Erhart .
Yes , I thought that would be best ;
best for all of us .
Our boxes were packed and everything settled .
But of=course when you sent for me , I ---- [ Holding out his hands to her .
] Good-bye , mother . Mrs .
Borkman . [ With a gesture of repulsion . ] Do_ _n't touch me !
Erhart . [ Gently . ] Is that your last word ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ Sternly . ] Yes .
Erhart . [ Turning . ] Good-bye to you , then , Aunt=Ella .
Ella=rentheim . [ Pressing his hands . ] Good-bye , Erhart !
Thanks , Aunt . [ Bowing to Borkman .
] Good-bye , father . [ Whispers to Mrs .
Wilton . ] Let us get away , the sooner the better . Mrs .
Wilton . [ In a low voice . ] Yes , let us . Mrs .
Wilton . [ Returning the smile , half ironically , half seriously . ] Men are so unstable , Mrs.=Borkman .
And women too .
Borkman . But you yourself ? Mrs .
Wilton . Oh , I shall know what to do , I assure you .
Good-bye to you all !
[ She bows and goes out by the hall door .
Erhart stands for a moment as=though wavering ;
then he turns and follows her .
Mrs .
Borkman . [ Dropping her folded hands . ] Childless .
Borkman . [ As=though awakening to a resolution . ] Then out into the storm alone !
My hat !
My cloak ! [ He goes hastily towards the door .
Ella=rentheim . [ In terror , stopping him .
] John=Gabriel , where are you going ?
Borkman . Out into the storm of life , I tell you .
Let me go , Ella !
Ella=rentheim . [ Holding him back . ] No , no , I will_ _n't let you out !
You are ill .
I can see it in your face !
Borkman . Let me go , I tell you !
Ella=rentheim . [ In the doorway .
] Help me to hold him , Gunhild ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Coldly and sharply , standing in the middle of the room .
] I will not try to hold any one in all the world . Let them go away from me -- both the one and the other !
As far -- as=far=as ever they please . [ Suddenly , with a piercing shriek .
] Erhart , do_ _n't leave me !
[ She rushes with outstretched arms towards the door .
ELLA Rentheim stops her .
Act Fourth
An open space outside the main building , which lies to the right .
A projecting corner of it is visible , with a door approached by a flight of low stone steps .
The background consists of steep fir-clad slopes , quite close at hand .
On the left are small scattered trees , forming the margin of a wood .
The snowstorm has ceased ;
but the newly fallen snow lies deep around . The fir-branches droop under heavy loads of snow .
The night is dark , with drifting clouds . Now=and=then the moon gleams out faintly .
Only a dim light is reflected from the snow . Borkman , Mrs . Borkman and Ella=rentheim are standing upon the steps , Borkman leaning wearily against the wall of the house .
He has an old-fashioned cape thrown over his shoulders , holds a soft grey felt hat in one hand and a thick knotted stick in the other .
Ella=rentheim carries her cloak over her arm. Mrs .
Ella=rentheim . [ Barring the way for Mrs . Borkman . ] Do_ _n't go after him , Gunhild !
Mrs . Borkman . [ In fear and agitation . ] Let me pass , I say !
He must not go away from me !
Ella=rentheim . It is utterly useless , I tell you !
You will never overtake him .
Mrs . Borkman . Let me go , Ella !
I will cry aloud after him all down the road .
And he must hear his mother's cry !
Ella=rentheim . He can_ _not hear you .
You may be sure he is in the sledge already . Mrs .
Borkman . No , no ; he can_ _n't be in the sledge yet !
Ella=rentheim . The doors are closed upon him long-ago , believe me . Mrs .
Borkman . [ In despair . ] If he is in the sledge , then he is there with her , with her -- her !
Borkman . [ Laughing gloomily .
] Then he probably will_ _n't hear his mother's cry .
Mrs . Borkman .
No , he will not hear it . [ Listening .
] Hark ! what is that ? Ella=rentheim . [ Also listening .
] It sounds like sledge-bells . Mrs . Borkman . [ With a suppressed scream .
] It is her sledge ! Ella=rentheim .
Perhaps it_ _s another . Mrs .
Borkman . No , no , it is Mrs.=Wilton's covered sledge !
I know the silver bells !
Hark !
Now they are driving right past here , at the foot of the hill !
Ella=rentheim . [ Quickly .
] Gunhild , if you want to cry out to him , now is the time !
] Make haste , Gunhild !
Now they are right under us ! Mrs .
Borkman . [ Stands for a moment undecided , then she stiffens and says sternly and coldly .
] No. I will not cry out to him .
Let Erhart Borkman pass away from me -- far , far away -- to what he calls life and happiness . [ The sound dies away in the distance .
Ella=rentheim . [ After a moment .
] Now the bells are out=of hearing . Mrs .
Borkman . They sounded like funeral bells .
Borkman . [ With a dry suppressed laugh .
] Oho -- it is not for me they are ringing to-night ! Mrs . Borkman .
No , but=for me -- and for him who has gone from me .
Borkman . [ With sudden animation , looking hard at her .
] Life and happiness , you say !
Ella=rentheim . For a little while at=any=rate . Mrs .
Borkman . Could you endure to let him know life and happiness , with her ?
Borkman . [ Coldly . ] Then you must be richer than I am in the power of love .
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking far-away .
] Perhaps it is the lack of love that keeps the power alive . Mrs . Borkman . [ Fixing her eyes on her .
Ella=rentheim . [ Stands for a time looking with a troubled expression at Borkman ;
then lays her hand cautiously on his shoulder .
] Come , John -- you must come in , too .
Borkman . [ As=if wakening . ] I ?
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , this winter air is too keen for you ;
I can see that , John .
So come -- come in with me -- into the house , into the warmth .
Borkman . [ Angrily .
] Up=to the gallery again , I suppose . Ella=rentheim .
No , rather into the room below . Borkman . [ His anger flaming forth . ] Never will I set foot under that roof again !
Ella=rentheim . Where will you go then ?
So late , and in the dark , John ?
Borkman . [ Putting on his hat . ] First=of=all , I will go out and see to all my buried treasures .
Ella=rentheim . [ Looking anxiously at him . ] John -- I do_ _n't understand you .
Borkman . [ With laughter , interrupted by coughing . ] Oh , it is not hidden plunder I mean ;
do_ _n't be afraid of that , Ella . [ Stopping , and pointing outwards .
] Do you see that man there ?
Who is it ?
[ Vilhelm Foldal , in an old cape , covered with snow , with his hat-brim turned down , and a large umbrella in his hand , advances towards the corner of the house , laboriously stumbling through the snow .
He is noticeably lame in his left-foot .
Borkman . Vilhelm !
What do you want with me again ?
Foldal . [ Looking up . ] Good=heavens , are you out on the steps , John Gabriel ? [ Bowing .
] And=Mrs.=Borkman , too , I see .
Borkman . [ Shortly . ] This is not Mrs.=Borkman .
Foldal . Oh , I beg pardon .
You see , I have lost my spectacles in the snow .
But how is it that you , who never put your foot out=of doors ---- ?
Borkman . [ Carelessly and gaily . ] It is high time I should come out into the open air again , do_ _n't you see ?
Nearly three years in detention -- five years in prison -- eight years in the gallery up there ----
Ella=rentheim . [ Distressed .
] Borkman , I beg you ---- Foldal .
Ah yes , yes , yes ! Borkman .
But I want to know what has brought you here .
Foldal . [ Still standing at the foot of the steps .
] I wanted to come up to you , John=Gabriel .
I felt I must come to you , in the gallery .
Ah me , that gallery ---- !
Borkman . Did you want to come up=to me after I had shown you the door ?
Foldal . Oh , I could_ _n't let that stand in the way .
Borkman . What have you done to your foot ?
I see you are limping ? Foldal .
Yes , what do you think -- I have been run over .
Ella=rentheim . Run over !
Foldal . Yes , by a covered sledge .
Borkman . Oho !
Foldal . With two horses .
They came down the hill at a tearing gallop .
I could_ _n't get out=of the way quick enough ;
and so ----
Ella=rentheim . And so they ran over you ?
Foldal . They came right down upon me , madam -- or miss .
They came right upon me and sent me rolling over=and=over in the snow -- so=that I lost my spectacles and got my umbrella broken . [ Rubbing his leg .
] And my ankle a little hurt too . Borkman . [ Laughing inwardly .
] Do you know who were in that sledge , Vilhelm ?
Foldal . No , how could I see ?
It was a covered sledge , and the curtains were down .
And the driver did_ _n't stop a moment after he had sent me spinning . But it does_ _n't matter a=bit , for ---- [ With an outburst .
] Oh , I am so happy , so happy !
Borkman . Happy ?
Foldal . Well , I do_ _n't exactly know what to call it .
But I think happy is the nearest word .
For something wonderful has happened !
And that is why I could_ _n't help -- I had to come out and share my happiness with you , John=Gabriel . Borkman . [ Harshly .
] Well , share away then ! Ella=rentheim .
Oh , but first take your friend indoors with you , Borkman .
Borkman . [ Sternly .
] I have told you I will not go into the house .
Ella=rentheim . But do_ _n't you hear , he has been run over !
Borkman . Oh , we are all of us run over , sometime or other in life .
The thing is to jump up again , and let no=one see you are hurt .
Foldal .
That is a profound saying , John=Gabriel .
But I can easily tell you my story out here , in a=few words .
Borkman . [ More mildly . ] Yes , please do , Vilhelm . Foldal .
Well , now you shall hear !
Only think , when I got home this evening after I had been with you , what did I find but a letter .
Can you guess who it was from ?
Borkman . Possibly from your little Frida ?
Foldal . Precisely !
Think of your hitting on it at=once !
Yes , it was a long letter from Frida .
A footman had brought it .
And can you imagine what was in it ? Borkman .
Perhaps it was to say good-bye to her mother and you ?
Foldal . Exactly !
How good you are at guessing , John=Gabriel !
Yes , she tells me that Mrs.=Wilton has taken such a fancy to her , and she is to go abroad with her and study music .
And Mrs.=Wilton has engaged a first-rate teacher who is to accompany them on the journey -- and to read with Frida .
For unfortunately she has been a good deal neglected in some branches , you see .
Borkman . [ Shaken with inward laughter .
] Of=course , of=course -- I see it all quite clearly , Vilhelm .
Foldal . [ Eagerly continuing .
] And only think , she knew nothing about the arrangement until this evening ;
at that party , you know , h'm !
And yet she found time to write to me .
And the letter is such a beautiful one -- so warm and affectionate , I assure you .
There is not a trace of contempt for her father in it .
And then what a delicate thought it was to say good-bye to us by letter -- before she started . [ Laughing .
] But of=course I can_ _n't let her go like that .
Borkman . [ Looks inquiringly at him . ] How so ? Foldal .
She tells me that they start early to-morrow morning ;
quite early . Borkman .
Oh indeed -- to-morrow ?
Does she tell you that ?
Foldal . [ Laughing and rubbing his hands . ] Yes ; but I know a trick worth two of that , you see !
I am going straight up=to Mrs.=Wilton's ----
Borkman . This evening ?
Foldal . Oh , it_ _s not so very late yet .
And even=if the house is shut up , I shall ring ;
without hesitation .
For I must and will see Frida before she starts .
Good-night , good-night ! [ Makes a movement to go .
Borkman .
Oh , you are thinking of my ankle ----
Borkman . Yes ; and in any case you will_ _n't get in at Mrs.=Wilton's .
Foldal . Yes , indeed I will .
I_ _ll go on ringing and knocking till some one comes and lets me in .
For I must and will see Frida .
Ella=rentheim .
Your daughter has gone already , Mr.=Foldal . Foldal . [ Stands as=though thunderstruck .
] Has=Frida gone already !
Are you quite sure ?
Who told you ? Borkman . We had it from her future teacher . Foldal .
Indeed ?
And who is he ?
Borkman . A certain Mr.=Erhart=Borkman .
Foldal . [ Beaming with joy . ] Your son , John=Gabriel ?
Is he going with them ?
Borkman . Yes ;
it is he that is to help Mrs.=Wilton with little Frida's education .
Foldal . Oh , Heaven be praised !
Then the child is in the best of hands .
But is it quite certain that they have started with her already ?
Borkman . They took her away in that sledge which ran you over in the road .
Foldal . [ Clasping his hands . ] To think that my little Frida was in that magnificent sledge !
Borkman . [ Nodding . ] Yes , yes , Vilhelm , your daughter has come to drive in her carriage .
And Master=Erhart , too .
Tell me , did you notice the silver bells ?
Foldal . Yes , indeed . Silver bells did you say ?
Were they silver ?
Real , genuine silver bells ?
Borkman . You may be quite sure of that .
Everything was genuine -- both outside and in .
Foldal . [ In quiet emotion .
] Is_ _n't it strange how fortune can sometimes befriend one ?
It is my -- my little gift of song that has transmuted itself into music in Frida .
So after all , it is not for nothing that I was born a poet .
For now she is going forth into the great wide world , that I once yearned so passionately to see .
Little Frida sets out in a splendid covered sledge with silver bells on the harness ----
Borkman . And runs over her father .
Foldal . [ Happily . ] Oh , pooh !
What does it matter about me , if only the child ---- !
Well , so I am too late , then , after all .
I must go home again and comfort her mother . I left her crying in the kitchen .
Borkman . Crying ?
Foldal . [ Smiling . ] Yes , would you believe it , she was crying her eyes out when I came away .
Borkman . And you are laughing , Vilhelm ? Foldal .
Yes , _I_ am , of=course .
But she , poor thing , she does_ _n't know any better , you see .
Well , good-bye !
It_ _s a good thing I have the tramway so handy .
Good-bye , good-bye , John=Gabriel .
Good-bye , Madam .
[ He bows and limps laboriously out by=the=way he came .
] Good-bye , Vilhelm !
It is not the first time in your life that you_ _ve been run over , old friend .
That is the effect of the prison air up yonder .
Ella=rentheim . I have never seen you like this before .
Borkman . No , for I suppose you have never seen an escaped convict before .
Ella=rentheim . Oh , do come into the house with me , John !
Borkman . It is no use trying to lure me in .
I have told you ----
Ella=rentheim . But when I beg and implore you ---- ?
For your own sake ----
[ The Maid opens the door , and stands in the doorway .
The Maid . I beg your pardon .
Mrs.=Borkman told me to lock the front door now .
Borkman . [ In a low voice , to ELLA .
] You see , they want to lock me up again !
Ella=rentheim . [ To The Maid . ] Mr.=Borkman is not=quite well .
He wants to have a little fresh air before coming in .
The Maid . But Mrs.=Borkman told me to ----
Ella=rentheim . I shall lock the door .
Just leave the key in the lock .
The Maid . Oh , very well ;
Borkman . [ Stands silent for a moment , and listens ;
then goes hastily down the steps and out into the open space . ] Now=I am outside the walls , Ella !
Now they will never get hold of me again !
Ella=rentheim . [ Who has gone down to him . ] But you are a free man in=there , too , John .
You can come and go just as you please .
Borkman . [ Softly , as=though in terror . ] Never under a roof again !
It is so good to be out here in the night .
If I went up into the gallery now , ceiling and walls would shrink together and crush me -- crush me flat as a fly .
Ella=rentheim .
But where will you go , then ?
Borkman . I will simply go on , and on , and on .
I will try if I can_ _not make my way to freedom , and life , and human beings again .
Will you go with me , Ella ?
Ella=rentheim . I ?
Now ?
Borkman . Yes , at=once !
Ella=rentheim .
But how far ? Borkman . As=far=as ever I can .
Ella=rentheim . Oh , but think what you are doing !
Out in this raw , cold winter night ----
Borkman . [ Speaking very hoarsely . ] Oho -- my lady is concerned about her health ?
Yes , yes -- I know it is delicate .
Ella=rentheim . It is your health I am concerned about .
Borkman .
Hohoho !
A dead man's health !
Ella=rentheim . [ Following him : holding him back .
] What did you call yourself ?
Borkman . A dead man , I said .
Do_ _n't you remember , Gunhild told me to lie quiet where I was ?
Ella=rentheim . [ With resolution , throwing her cloak around her . ] I will go with you , John .
Borkman . Yes , we two belong to each=other , Ella . [ Advancing .
] So come !
[ They have gradually passed into the low wood on the left .
It conceals them little=by=little , until they are quite lost to sight .
The house and the open space disappear .
The landscape , consisting of wooded slopes and ridges , slowly changes and grows wilder and wilder .
] Where are we going , John ?
I do_ _n't recognise this place .
BORKMAN's Voice . [ Higher up . ] Just follow my footprints in the snow !
ELLA=RENTHEIM's Voice . But why need we climb so high ?
BORKMAN's Voice . [ Nearer at hand . ] We must go up the winding path . Ella=rentheim . [ Still hidden .
] Oh , but I can_ _n't go much further .
Borkman . [ On the verge of the wood to the right . ] Come , come !
We are not far from the view now .
There used to be a seat there .
Ella=rentheim . [ Appearing among the trees .
] Do you remember it ? Borkman .
You can rest there . [ They have emerged upon a small high-lying , open plateau in the wood .
The mountain rises abruptly behind them .
To the left , far=below , an extensive fiord landscape , with high ranges in the distance , towering one above the other .
On the plateau , to the left , a dead fir-tree with a bench under it .
The snow lies deep upon the plateau .
[ Borkman and , after him , Ella=rentheim enter from the right and wade with difficulty through the snow .
] Come here , Ella , and you shall see . Ella=rentheim . [ Coming up=to him .
] What do you want to show me , John ? Borkman . [ Pointing outwards .
We have often sat on this bench before , and looked out into a much , much further distance .
Borkman . It was a dreamland we then looked out over .
Ella=rentheim . [ Nodding sadly . ] It was the dreamland of our life , yes .
And now that land is buried in snow .
And the old tree is dead .
Borkman . [ Not listening to her . ] Can you see the smoke of the great steamships out on the fiord ?
Ella=rentheim .
No. Borkman .
I can . They come and they go .
They weave a network of fellowship all round the world .
They shed light and warmth over the souls of men in many thousands of homes .
That was what I dreamed of doing .
Ella=rentheim . [ Softly . ] And it remained a dream . Borkman .
It remained a dream , yes . [ Listening .
] And hark , down by the river , dear !
The factories are working !
My factories !
All those that I would have created !
Listen !
Do you hear them humming ?
The night shift is on -- so they are working night and day .
Hark ! hark !
the wheels are whirling and the bands are flashing -- round and round=and=round .
Can_ _n't you hear , Ella ?
Ella=rentheim .
No. Borkman .
I can hear it . Ella=rentheim . [ Anxiously .
] I think you are mistaken , John . Borkman . [ More=and=more fired up . ] Oh , but all these -- they are only like the outworks around the kingdom , I tell you !
Ella=rentheim . The kingdom , you say ?
What kingdom ?
Borkman . My kingdom , of=course !
The kingdom I was on the point of conquering when I -- when I died .
Ella=rentheim . [ Shaken , in a low voice .
] Oh , John , John ! Borkman .
And now there it lies -- defenceless , masterless -- exposed to all the robbers and plunderers .
Ella , do you see the mountain chains there -- far-away ?
They soar , they tower aloft , one behind the other !
That is my vast , my infinite , inexhaustible kingdom !
Ella=rentheim . Oh , but there comes an icy blast from that kingdom , John !
Borkman . That blast is the breath of life to me .
That blast comes to me like a greeting from subject spirits .
I seem to touch them , the prisoned millions ;
I can see the veins of metal stretch out their winding , branching , luring arms to me .
I saw them before my eyes like living shapes , that night when I stood in the strong-room with the candle in my hand .
You begged to be liberated , and I tried to free you .
But my strength failed me ;
and the treasure sank back into the deep again . [ With outstretched hands .
] But=I will whisper it to you here in the stillness of the night : I love you , as you lie there spellbound in the deeps and the darkness !
I love you , unborn treasures , yearning for the light !
I love you , with all your shining train of power and glory !
I love you , love you , love you !
Ella=rentheim . [ In suppressed but rising agitation .
] Yes , your love is still down there , John .
It has always been rooted there .
But here , in the light of day , here there was a living , warm , human heart that throbbed and glowed for you .
And this heart you crushed .
Oh worse than that !
Ten times worse !
You sold it for -- for ----
Borkman . [ Trembles ;
a cold shudder seems to go through him . ] For the kingdom -- and the power -- and the glory -- you mean ?
Ella=rentheim .
Yes , that is what I mean .
I have said it once before to-night : you have murdered the love-life in the woman who loved you .
And whom you loved in=return , so=far as you could love any one . [ With uplifted arm. ] And therefore I prophesy to you , John=Gabriel Borkman -- you will never touch the price you demanded for the murder .
You will never enter in triumph into your cold , dark kingdom !
Borkman . [ Staggers to the bench and seats himself heavily . ] I almost fear your prophecy will come true , Ella .
Ella=rentheim . [ Going up=to him . ] You must not fear it , John .
That is the best thing that can happen to you .
Borkman . [ With a shriek ;
clutching at his breast . ] Ah ---- ! [ Feebly .
] Now it let me go again .
Ella=rentheim . [ Shaking him . ] What was it , John ?
Borkman . [ Sinking down against the back of the seat . ] It was a hand of ice that clutched at my heart .
Ella=rentheim .
John !
Did you feel the ice-hand again !
Borkman . [ Murmurs .
] No. No ice-hand .
Ella=rentheim . [ Tears off her cloak and throws it over him .
] Lie still where you are !
I will go and bring help for you .
[ She goes a step or two towards the right ;
Ella=rentheim . [ Softly and firmly .
] No. It is best so , John=Borkman .
Best for you .
A short silence .
[ Mrs .
Borkman , wrapped in a mantle , comes through the wood on the right .
The Maid goes before her carrying a lantern .
] Yes , yes , ma'am , here are their tracks . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Peering around .
] Yes , here they are !
They are sitting there on the bench . [ Calls .
] Ella !
Ella=rentheim . [ Rising . ] Are you looking for us ? Mrs .
Borkman . [ Sternly . ] Yes , you see I have to .
Ella=rentheim . [ Pointing . ] Look , there he lies , Gunhild . Mrs .
Borkman . Sleeping ?
Ella=rentheim . A long , deep sleep , I think . Mrs . Borkman . [ With an outburst .
] Ella ! [ Controls herself and asks in a low voice .
] Did he do it -- of his own accord ?
Ella=rentheim . No.
Mrs . Borkman . [ Relieved . ] Not by his own hand then ?
Ella=rentheim .
No. It was an ice-cold metal hand that gripped him by the heart .
Mrs . Borkman . [ To The Maid .
] Go for help .
Get the men to come up from the farm . The Maid .
Yes , I will , ma'am . [ To herself .
] Lord save us ! [ She goes out through the wood to the right .
Mrs .
Borkman . [ Standing behind the bench . ] So the night air has killed him ----
Ella=rentheim . So it appears . Mrs .
Borkman . ---- strong man that he was .
Borkman . [ With a gesture of repulsion . ] No , no , no. [ Lowering her voice .
] He was a miner's son , John=Gabriel=Borkman .
He could not live in the fresh air .
Ella=rentheim . It was rather the cold that killed him . Mrs .
Borkman . [ Shakes her head . ] The cold , you say ?
The cold -- that had killed him long-ago .
Ella=rentheim . [ Nodding to her . ] Yes -- and changed us two into shadows . Mrs .
Borkman . You are right there .
Borkman . Yes , the coldness of heart .
-- And now I think we two may hold out our hands to each=other , Ella .
Ella=rentheim . I think we may , now . Mrs .
Borkman . We twin sisters -- over him we have both loved .
Ella=rentheim . We two shadows -- over the dead man .
