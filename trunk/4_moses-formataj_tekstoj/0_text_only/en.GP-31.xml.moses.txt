( A simply furnished room in a farmhouse .
The door and the windows in the background open on a landscape .
In the middle of the room stands a big dining-table , covered at one end by books , writing materials , and antiquities ;
( On the left side hangs a bookshelf .
( Mr . X. enters , also in his shirt-sleeves .
) ( Mr .
Y. starts violently , puts the book back on the shelf upside-down , and pretends to be looking for another volume .
) Mr . X.=This heat is horrible .
I guess we are going to have a thunderstorm .
Mr .
Y.=What makes you think so ?
Mr . X.=The bells have a=kind=of dry ring to them , the flies are sticky , and the hens cackle .
I meant to go fishing , but I could_ _n't find any worms .
Do_ _n't you feel nervous ?
Mr . Y . [ Cautiously ] I ?
-- A little .
Mr . X.=Well , for that matter , you always look as=if you were expecting thunderstorms .
Mr . Y . [ With a start ] Do=I ?
Mr . X.=Now , you are going away tomorrow , of=course , so it is not to be wondered at that you are a=little « journey-proud . »
-- Anything new ?
-- Oh , there_ _s the mail ! [ Picks up some letters from the table ] My , I have palpitation of the heart every time I open a letter !
Nothing but debts , debts , debts !
Have you ever had any debts ?
Mr . Y . [ After some reflection ] N-no.
Mr . X.=Well , then you do_ _n't know what it means to receive a=lot=of overdue bills . [ Reads one of the letters ] The rent unpaid -- the landlord acting nasty -- my wife in despair .
And here am I sitting waist-high in gold ! [ He opens an iron-banded box that stands on the table ;
then both sit down at the table , facing each=other ] Just look -- here I have six thousand crowns' worth of gold which I have dug up in the last fortnight .
This bracelet alone would bring me the three hundred and fifty crowns I need .
And with all of it I might make a fine career for myself .
Then I could get the illustrations made for my treatise at=once ;
I could get my work printed , and -- I could travel !
Why do_ _n't I do it , do you suppose ? Mr .
Y . I suppose you are afraid to be found out . Mr .
X.=That , too , perhaps .
But do_ _n't you think an intelligent fellow like myself might fix matters so=that he was never found out ?
I am alone all=the=time -- with nobody watching me -- while I am digging out=there in the fields .
It would_ _n't be strange if I put something in my own pockets now=and=then .
Mr . Y.=Yes , but the worst danger lies in disposing of the stuff . Mr .
X.=Pooh !
I_ _d melt it down , of=course -- every bit of it -- and then I_ _d turn it into coins -- with just as much gold in them as genuine ones , of=course --
Mr . Y.=Of course ! Mr .
X.=Well , you can easily see why .
For if I wanted to dabble in counterfeits , then I need not go digging for gold first . [ Pause ] It is a strange thing anyhow , that if anybody=else did what I can_ _not make myself do , then I_ _d be willing to acquit him -- but I could_ _n't possibly acquit myself .
I might even make a brilliant speech in defence of the thief , proving that this gold was _res nullius_ , or nobody's , as it had been deposited at a time when property rights did not=yet exist ;
Y.=And probably it would be much easier for you to do this if the -- hm !
-- the thief had not been prompted by actual need , but by a mania for collecting , for=instance -- or by scientific aspirations -- by the ambition to keep a discovery to himself .
Do_ _n't you think so ?
Mr . X.=You mean that I could not acquit him if actual need had been the motive ?
Yes , for that_ _s the only motive which the law will not accept in extenuation .
That motive makes a plain theft of it . Mr .
Y.=And this you could_ _n't excuse ?
Mr .
X.=Oh , excuse -- no , I guess not , as the law would_ _n't .
On the other hand , I must admit that it would be hard for me to charge a collector with theft merely because he had appropriated some specimen not=yet represented in his own collection .
Mr . Y.=So that vanity or ambition might excuse what could not be excused by need ?
Mr . X.=And yet need ought=to be the more telling excuse -- the only one , in=fact ?
But I feel as I have said .
Y.=And=I suppose you count it a great merit that you can_ _not -- hm !
-- steal ?
Mr . X.=No , my disinclination to steal is just as irresistible as the inclination to do so is irresistible with some people . So it can_ _not be called a merit .
I can_ _not do it , and the other one can_ _not refrain !
-- But you understand , of=course , that I am not without a desire to own this gold .
Why do_ _n't I take it then ?
Because I can_ _not !
It_ _s an inability -- and the lack of something can_ _not be called a merit .
There !
[ Closes the box with a slam . Stray clouds have cast their shadows on the landscape and darkened the room now=and=then .
Now it grows quite dark as when a thunderstorm is approaching . ] Mr . X.=How close the air is !
I guess the storm is coming all right .
Mr . X.=Are you afraid of thunder ?
Mr . Y.=It's just as=well to be careful . ( They resume their seats at the table . ) Mr .
X.=That's what you always say when I grow tired of talking about myself and want to turn my attention to you .
Perhaps that was the reason why I took to you as I did -- because you let me talk about myself ?
All=at=once we seemed like old friends .
There were no angles about you against which I could bump myself , no pins that pricked .
There was something soft about your whole person , and you overflowed with that tact which only well-educated people know how to show .
You never made a noise when you came home late at night or got up early in the morning . You were patient in small things , and you gave in whenever a conflict seemed threatening .
In a word , you proved yourself the perfect companion ! But you were entirely too compliant not to set me wondering about you in the long run -- and you are too timid , too easily frightened .
It seems almost as=if you were made up of two different personalities . Why , as I sit here looking at your back in the mirror over=there -- it is as=if I were looking at somebody=else . ( Mr . Y. turns around and stares at the mirror .
) Mr . X.=No , you can_ _not get a glimpse of your own back , man !
-- In front you appear like a fearless sort of fellow , one meeting his fate with bared breast , but from behind -- really , I do_ _n't want to be impolite , but -- you look as=if you were carrying a burden , or as if you were crouching to escape a raised stick .
And when I look at that red cross your suspenders make on your white shirt -- well , it looks to me like some kind of emblem , like a trade-mark on a packing-box -- Mr .
X.=It's coming -- do_ _n't you worry !
-- And your neck !
It looks as if there ought=to be another kind of face on=top=of it , a face quite different in type from yours .
And your ears come so close together behind that sometimes I wonder what race you belong to . [ A flash of lightning lights up the room ] Why , it looked as=if that might have struck the sheriff's house !
Mr . Y . [ Alarmed ] The sheriff's ! Mr .
X.=Oh , it just looked that way .
But I do_ _n't think we_ _ll get much of this storm .
Sit down now and let us have a talk , as you are going away to-morrow .
One thing I find strange is that you , with whom I have become so intimate in this short time -- that yon are one of those whose image I can_ _not call up when I am away from them .
When you are not here , and I happen to think of you , I always get the vision of another acquaintance -- one who does not resemble you , but with whom you have certain traits in common .
Mr . Y.=Who is he ?
Mr . X .
I do_ _n't want to name him , but -- I used for several years to take my meals at a certain place , and there , at the side-table where they kept the whiskey and the otter preliminaries , I met a little blond man , with blond , faded eyes .
He had a wonderful faculty for making his way through a crowd , without jostling anybody or being jostled himself . And from his customary place down by the door he seemed perfectly able to reach whatever he wanted on a table that stood some six feet away from him . He seemed always happy just to be in company .
But when he met anybody he knew , then the joy of it made him roar with laughter , and he would hug and pat the other fellow as=if he had_ _n't seen a human face for years .
When anybody stepped on his foot , he smiled as=if eager to apologise for being in the way .
For two years I watched him and amused myself by guessing at his occupation and character . But I never asked who he was ;
I did_ _n't want to know , you see , for then all the fun would have been spoiled at=once .
That man had just your quality of being indefinite .
At different times I made him out to be a teacher who had never got his licence , a non- commissioned officer , a druggist , a government clerk , a detective -- and like you , he looked as=if made out=of two pieces , for the front of him never quite fitted the back .
One-day I happened to read in a newspaper about a big forgery committed by a well-known government official .
Then I learned that my indefinite gentleman had been a partner of the forger's brother , and that his name was Strawman .
Later on I learned that the aforesaid Strawman used to run a circulating library , but that he was now the police reporter of a big daily .
How in the world could I hope to establish a connection between the forgery , the police , and my little man's peculiar manners ?
It was beyond me ;
and when I asked a friend whether Strawman had ever been punished for something , my friend could_ _n't answer either yes or no -- he just did_ _n't know ! [ Pause . ] Mr . Y.=Well , had he ever been -- punished ? Mr .
X.=No , he had not . [ Pause .
] Mr .
X.=Exactly !
Mr . Y.=And did you become acquainted with him afterward ? Mr .
X.=No , I did_ _n't want to . [ Pause . ]
Mr . Y.=Would you have been willing to make his acquaintance if he had been -- punished ?
Mr . X.=Perfectly !
( Mr . Y. rises and walks back=and=forth several times . ) Mr . X.=Sit still !
Why can_ _n't you sit still ?
Mr . Y.=How did you get your liberal view of human conditions ?
Are you a Christian ? Mr .
X.=Oh , can_ _n't you see that I am not ? ( Mr .
Y. makes a face . ) Mr . X.=The=Christians require forgiveness . But I require punishment in=order=that the balance , or whatever you may call it , be restored .
And you , who have served a term , ought=to know the difference . Mr .
Y . [ Stands motionless and stares at Mr . X . , first with wild , hateful eyes , then with surprise and admiration ] How -- could -- you -- know -- that ?
Mr . X.=Why , I could see it .
Mr . Y.=How ?
How could you see it ? Mr .
X , Oh , with a little practice .
It is an art , like many others .
But do_ _n't let us talk of it any=more . [ He looks at his watch , arranges a document on the table , dips a pen in the ink-well , and hands it to Mr .
Y . ] I must be thinking of my tangled affairs . Will_ _n't you please witness my signature on this note here ?
Y . I am not going by way of Malmo . Mr .
X.=Oh , you are not ?
Mr . Y.=No.
Mr . X.=But that need not prevent you from witnessing my signature .
Mr . Y . N-no !
-- I never write my name on papers of that kind -- Mr . X . -- any longer !
This is the fifth time you have refused to write your own name .
The first time nothing more serious was involved than the receipt for a registered letter .
Then I began to watch you .
And since=then I have noticed that you have a morbid fear of a pen filled with ink .
You have not written a single letter since you came here -- only a post-card , and that you wrote with a blue pencil .
You understand now that I have figured out the exact nature of your slip ?
Furthermore !
This is something like the seventh time you have refused to come with me to Malmo , which place you have not visited at=all during all this time .
And yet you came the whole way from America merely to have a look at Malmo !
And every morning you walk a couple of miles , up=to the old mill , just to get a glimpse of the roofs of Malmo in the distance .
And when you stand over=there at the right-hand window and look out through the third pane from the bottom on the left side , yon can see the spired turrets of the castle and the tall chimney of the county jail .
Y.=This means that you despise me ? Mr .
X.=Oh , no !
Mr . Y.=Yes , you do -- you can_ _not but do it !
Mr .
X.=No -- here's my hand .
X . [ Drawing back his hand ] Do_ _n't lick hands like a dog !
Mr . Y.=Pardon me , sir , but you are the first one who has let me touch his hand after learning -- Mr . X.=And now you call me « sir ! »
-- What scares me about you is that you do_ _n't feel exonerated , washed clean , raised to the old level , as good as anybody=else , when you have suffered your punishment .
Do you care to tell me how it happened ?
Would you ?
Mr . Y . [ Twisting uneasily ] Yes , but you will_ _n't believe what I say .
But I_ _ll tell you . Then you can see for yourself that I am no Ordinary criminal .
X.=Suit yourself .
Mr . Y . [ Opens the door ;
then he sits down at the table and begins to speak with exaggerated display of feeling , theatrical gestures , and a good deal of false emphasis ] Yes , I_ _ll tell you !
I was a student in the university at Lund , and I needed to get a loan from a bank .
I had no pressing debts , and my father owned some property -- not a great deal , of=course .
However , I had sent the note to the second man of the two who were to act as security , and , contrary=to expectations , it came back with a refusal .
For a while I was completely stunned by the blow , for it was a very unpleasant surprise -- most unpleasant !
The note was lying in=front of me on the table , and the letter lay beside it .
At=first my eyes stared hopelessly at those lines that pronounced my doom -- that is , not a death-doom , of=course , for I could easily find other securities , as=many=as I wanted -- but as I have already said , it was very annoying just the same .
And as I was sitting there quite unconscious of any evil intention , my eyes fastened upon the signature of the letter , which would have made my future secure if it had only appeared in the right place .
It was an unusually well- written signature -- and you know how sometimes one may absent- mindedly scribble a sheet of paper full of meaningless words .
I had a pen in my hand -- [ picks up a penholder from the table ] like this . And somehow it just began to run -- I do_ _n't want to claim that there was anything mystical -- anything of a spiritualistic nature back of it -- for that kind of thing I do_ _n't believe in !
It was a wholly unreasoned , mechanical process -- my copying of that beautiful autograph over=and=over again .
When all the clean space on the letter was used up , I had learned to reproduce the signature automatically -- and then -- [ throwing away the penholder with a violent gesture ] then I forgot all about it .
That night I slept long and heavily . And when I woke up , I could feel that I had been dreaming , but I could_ _n't recall the dream itself .
At times it was as=if a door had been thrown ajar , and then I seemed to see the writing-table with the note on it as=in a distant memory -- and when I got out=of bed , I was forced up=to the table , just as=if , after careful deliberation , I had formed an irrevocable decision to sign the name to that fateful paper .
All thought of the consequences , of the risk involved , had disappeared -- no hesitation remained -- it was almost as=if I was fulfilling some sacred duty -- and so I wrote ! [ Leaps to his feet ] What could it be ?
Was it some kind of outside influence , a case of mental suggestion , as they call it ?
But from whom could it come ?
I was sleeping alone in that room .
Could it possibly be my primitive self -- the savage to whom the keeping of faith is an unknown thing -- which pushed to the front while my consciousness was asleep -- together with the criminal will of that self , and its inability to calculate the results of an action ?
Tell me , what do you think of it ? Mr .
X . [ As=if he had to force the words out=of himself ] Frankly speaking , your story does not convince me -- there are gaps in it , but these may depend on your failure to recall all the details -- and I have read something about criminal suggestion -- or I think I have , at=least -- hm !
But all that is neither here nor there ! You have taken your medicine -- and you have had the courage to acknowledge your fault .
Now we will_ _n't talk of it any=more .
Mr . Y.=Yes , yes , yes , we must talk of it -- till I become sure of my innocence .
Mr . X.=Well , are you not ?
Mr . Y.=No , I am not !
Mr . X.=That's just what bothers me , I tell you .
It_ _s exactly what is bothering me !
-- Do_ _n't you feel fairly sure that every human being hides a skeleton in his closet ?
Have we not , all of us , stolen and lied as children ?
Undoubtedly !
Well , now there are persons who remain children all their lives , so=that they can_ _not control their unlawful desires .
Then comes the opportunity , and there you have your criminal .
-- But I can_ _not understand why you do_ _n't feel innocent .
If the child is not held responsible , why should the criminal be regarded differently ?
It is the more strange because -- well , perhaps I may come to repent it later . [ Pause ] I , for my part , have killed a man , and I have never suffered any qualms on=account=of it . Mr .
Y . [ Very much interested ] Have -- you ? Mr .
X , Yes , I , and none else !
Perhaps you do_ _n't care to shake hands with a murderer ?
Mr . Y . [ Pleasantly ] Oh , what nonsense ! Mr .
X.=Yes , but I have not been punished ,
Me . Y . [ Growing more familiar and taking on a superior tone ] So much the better for you !
-- How did you get out=of it ?
Mr . X.=There was nobody to accuse me , no suspicions , no witnesses .
This is the way it happened .
One Christmas=I was invited to hunt with a fellow-student a little way out=of Upsala .
He sent a besotted old coachman to meet me at the station , and this fellow went to sleep on the box , drove the horses into a fence , and upset the whole _equipage_ in a ditch . I am not going to pretend that my life was in danger .
It was sheer impatience which made me hit him across the neck with the edge of my hand -- you know the way -- just to wake him up -- and the result was that he never woke up at=all , but collapsed then and there .
Mr . Y . [ Craftily ] And did you report it ?
Mr . X.=No , and these were my reasons for not doing so .
The man left no family behind him , or anybody=else to whom his life could be of the slightest use .
He had already outlived his allotted period of vegetation , and his place might just as=well be filled by somebody more in need of it . On=the=other=hand , my life was necessary to the happiness of my parents and myself , and perhaps also to the progress of my science .
Y.=Oh , that_ _s the way you measure the value of a human life ?
Mr . X.=In the present case , yes .
Mr . Y.=But the sense of guilt -- that balance you were speaking of ? Mr .
X . I had no sense of guilt , as I had committed no crime .
Y.=Yes , but even the unintentional killing of a man is punished with a two-year term at hard labour -- which is exactly what one gets for -- writing names .
Mr . X.=Oh , you may be sure I have thought of it .
And more=than one night I have dreamt myself in prison .
Tell me now -- is it really as bad as they say to find oneself behind bolt and bar ?
Mr . Y.=You bet it is !
X.=Is_ _n't it a mask that is being torn off , perhaps ?
Which would_ _n't be a bad idea , I should say .
Mr . Y.=Yes , you can have your little jest about it !
-- And then they cut down your food , so=that every day and every hour you become conscious of the border line between life and death .
Every vital function is more=or=less checked . You can feel yourself shrinking . And your soul , which was to be cured and improved , is instead put on a starvation diet -- pushed back a thousand years into outlived ages . You are not permitted to read anything but what was written for the savages who took part in the migration of the peoples .
You hear of nothing but what will never happen in heaven ;
and what actually does happen on the earth is kept hidden from you . You are torn out=of your surroundings , reduced from your own class , put beneath those who are really beneath yourself . Then you get a sense of living in the bronze age .
You come to feel as=if you were dressed in skins , as=if you were living in a cave and eating out of a trough -- ugh ! Mr .
X.=But there is reason back of all that .
One who acts as=if he belonged to the bronze age might surely be expected to don the proper costume .
Mr . Y . [ Irately ] Yes , you sneer !
You who have behaved like a man from the stone age -- and who are permitted to live in the golden age .
Mr .
Y . [ With a poorly suppressed snarl ] Nothing at=all .
Mr . X.=Now you lie -- because you are too much of a coward to say all you think .
Mr . Y.=Am I a coward ?
You think so ?
But I was no coward when I dared to show myself around here , where I had had to suffer as I did .
-- But can you tell what makes one suffer most while in=there ?
-- It is that the others are not in=there too ! Mr .
X.=What others ? Mr .
Y.=Those that go unpunished .
Mr . X.=Are you thinking of me ? Mr . Y .
I am . Mr .
X.=But=I have committed no crime . Mr .
Y.=Oh , have_ _n't you ?
Mr . X.=No , a misfortune is no crime . Mr . Y.=So , it_ _s a misfortune to commit murder ? Mr . X .
I have not committed murder .
Mr . Y.=Is it not murder to kill a person ?
Mr . X.=Not always .
The law speaks of murder , manslaughter , killing in self-defence -- and it makes a distinction between intentional and unintentional killing .
However -- now you really frighten me , for it_ _s becoming plain to me that you belong to the most dangerous of all human groups -- that of the stupid .
Mr . Y.=So you imagine that I am stupid ?
Well , listen -- would you like me to show you how clever I am ?
Mr . X.=Come on !
Mr . Y . I think you_ _ll have to admit that there is both logic and wisdom in the argument I_ _m now going to give you . You have suffered a misfortune which might have brought you two years at hard labor .
You have completely escaped the disgrace of being punished .
And here you see before you a man -- who has also suffered a misfortune -- the victim of an unconscious impulse -- and who has had to stand two years of hard labor for it .
Only by some great scientific achievement can this man wipe off the taint that has become attached to him without any fault of his own -- but in order to arrive at some=such achievement , he must have money -- a=lot=of money -- and money this minute !
Do_ _n't you think that the other one , the unpunished one , would bring a=little better balance into these unequal human conditions if he paid a penalty in=the=form=of a fine ?
Do_ _n't you think so ?
Mr . X . [ Calmly ] Yes . Mr .
Y.=Then we understand each=other .
-- Hm ! [ Pause ] What do you think would be reasonable ? Mr .
X.=Reasonable ?
The minimum fine in such a case is fixed by the law at fifty crowns .
But this whole question is settled by the fact that the dead man left no relatives . Mr .
Y.=Apparently you do_ _n't want to understand .
Then I_ _ll have to speak plainly : it is to me you must pay that fine .
Mr . X .
I have never heard that forgers have the right to collect fines imposed for manslaughter .
And , besides , there is no prosecutor . Mr .
Y.=There is_ _n't ?
Well -- how would I do ? Mr . X.=Oh , _now_ we are getting the matter cleared up !
How much do you want for becoming my accomplice ?
Mr . Y.=Six thousand crowns .
Mr . X.=That's too much .
And where am I to get them ? ( Mr .
Y. points to the box . )
Mr . X.=No , I do_ _n't want to do that .
I do_ _n't want to become a thief .
Mr . Y.=Oh , do_ _n't put on any airs now !
Do you think I_ _ll believe that you have_ _n't helped yourself out=of that box before ?
Mr . X . [ As=if speaking to himself ] Think only , that I could let myself be fooled so completely .
But that_ _s the way with these soft natures .
You like them , and then it_ _s so easy to believe that they like you . And that_ _s the reason why I have always been on my guard against people I take a liking to !
-- So you are firmly convinced that I have helped myself out=of the box before ?
Mr . Y.=Certainly !
Mr . X.=And you are going to report me if you do_ _n't get six thousand crowns ?
Mr . Y.=Most decidedly !
You can_ _n't get out=of it , so there_ _s no use trying .
Mr . X.=You think I am going to give my father a thief for son , my wife a thief for husband , my children a thief for father , my fellow-workers a thief for colleague ?
No , that will never happen !
-- Now I am going over to the sheriff to report the killing myself .
Mr . Y . [ Jumps up and begins to pick up his things ] Wait a moment ! Mr .
X.=For what ?
Mr . Y . [ Stammering ] Oh , I thought -- as I am no=longer needed -- it would_ _n't be necessary for me to stay -- and I might just as=well leave .
Mr . X.=No , you may not !
Y . [ Sits down after having put on a dark coat ] What are you up to now ?
Mr .
Y . [ Alarmed ] What kind of wonderful things are you discovering now ?
Mr . X . I see in the mirror that you are a thief -- a plain , ordinary thief !
A moment ago , while you had only the white shirt on , I could notice that there was something wrong about my book-shelf . I could_ _n't make out just what it was , for I had to listen to you and watch you .
But as my antipathy increased , my vision became more acute . And now , with your black coat to furnish the needed color contrast For the red back of the book , which before could_ _n't be seen against the red of your suspenders -- now I see that you have been reading about forgeries in Bernheim's work on mental suggestion -- for you turned the book upside-down in putting it back .
So even that story of yours was stolen !
For tins reason I think myself entitled to conclude that your crime must have been prompted by need , or by mere love of pleasure .
Mr . Y.=By need !
If you only knew -- Mr . X.=If _you_ only knew the extent of the need I have had to face and live through !
But that_ _s another story !
Let_ _s proceed with your case .
That you have been in prison -- I take that for=granted .
But it happened in America , for it was American prison life you described .
Another thing may also be taken for=granted , namely , that you have not borne your punishment on this side . Mr .
Y.=How can you imagine anything of the kind ?
Me . X.=There you see !
The first-time I mentioned the sheriff , in connection with the storm , you wanted also to run-away .
And when a person has served out his time he does_ _n't care to visit an old mill every day just to look at a prison , or to stand by the window -- in a word , you are at=once punished and unpunished .
Mr . Y . [ Completely beaten ] May I go now ?
Mr . X.=Now you can go .
Mr . Y . [ Putting his things together ] Are you angry at me ?
Mr .
X.=Yes -- would you prefer me to pity you ?
Mr . Y . [ Sulkily ] Pity ?
Do you think you_ _re any better than I ?
Mr . X.=Of course I do , as I Am better than you .
I am wiser , and I am less of a menace to prevailing property rights . Mr .
Y.=You think you are clever , but perhaps I am as clever as you .
X . [ Looking hard at Mr . Y . ] So we have to have another bout !
What kind of mischief are you up=to now ?
Mr . Y.=That's my secret .
Mr . X.=Just look at me -- oh , you mean to write my wife an anonymous letter giving away My secret !
Mr . Y.=Well , how are you going to prevent it ?
You do_ _n't dare to have me arrested .
So you_ _ll have to let me go .
And when I am gone , I can do what I please .
Mr . X.=You devil !
So you have found my vulnerable spot ! Do you want to make a real murderer out=of me ? Mr .
Y.=That's more=than you_ _ll ever become -- coward !
Mr . X.=There you see how different people are .
You have a feeling that I can_ _not become guilty of the same kind of acts as you .
And that gives you the upper hand . But suppose you forced me to treat you as I treated that coachman ?
[ He lifts his hand as=if ready to hit Mr . Y . ] Mr . Y . [ Staring Mr . X. straight in the face ] You can_ _n't !
It_ _s too much for one who could_ _n't save himself by=means=of the box over there . Me .
X.=So you do_ _n't think I have taken anything out=of the box ?
Mr .
Y.=You were too cowardly -- just as you were too cowardly to tell your wife that she had married a murderer .
Mr . X.=You are a different man from what I took you to be -- if stronger or weaker , I can_ _not tell -- if more criminal or less , that_ _s none of my concern -- but decidedly more stupid ;
that much is quite plain . For stupid you were when you wrote another person's name instead=of begging -- as I have had to do .
Stupid you were when you stole things out=of my book -- could you not guess that I might have read my own books ?
Stupid you were when you thought yourself cleverer than me , and when you thought that I could be lured into becoming a thief .
Stupid you were when you thought balance could be restored by giving the world two thieves instead=of one . But most stupid of all you were when you thought I had failed to provide a safe corner-stone for my happiness .
Go ahead and write my wife as many anonymous letters as you please about her husband having killed a man -- she knew that long=before we were married !
-- Have you had enough now ?
Mr . Y.=May=I go ? Mr .
X.=Now you _have_ to go !
And at=once !
I_ _ll send your things after you !
-- Get out=of here !
