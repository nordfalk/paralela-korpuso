Preface
The distinguished Reader has in his / her hands the English=_=Esperanto translation of the definitive text of the Treaty Establishing A Constitution For Europe signed in Rome , on 29 October 2004 .
At time of writing , the European=Union has twenty-one ( 21 ) official working languages , but in practice the EU=Commission has only three working languages : English , French and German .
English is advancing steadily to become the sole working language .
This would mean , however , that all the other languages would play a subordinate role - in contradiction to the principles of the Constitutional=Treaty .
The privileged status of English shows very clearly that for the time being the European=Union has no « bridge language » acceptable to all nations , which would assure equal rights to all languages and their speakers , be easy to learn quickly and economically by every European citizen , and which thus would assure the survival of the smaller languages .
In the long-term , national languages can survive only if such a bridge language , not backed by any military , economic and political power , is used .
The expansion of the Roman=Empire wiped out a considerable number of the original European languages .
In the Middle=Ages=Latin ( which in the course of centuries gave birth to the Neolatin languages ) temporarily assured linguistic equal opportunity in the fields of religion , culture and science .
Nowadays UNESCO recommends that everybody should use three languages .
These are : the mother tongue ( which eventually may be the language of a small minority ) , the language of local communication ( as=a=rule , the national language ) and an international language .
We are convinced that the least objectionable « bridge language » , or interethnic language , is the planned international language Esperanto .
« The use of any national language at the European level is unjust , causes much suffering and costs to those who have to learn it ;
and in the long run it leads to the disappearance of some languages and cultures . » ( Renato Corsetti ) The equal rights and survival of languages can be assured only if the European=Union accepts a neutral , easy-to-learn « bridge language » for interethnic communication , introducing it step=by=step .
Esperanto , with its 120-year history and abundant literature , can be mastered in one tenth of the time required for learning one of the widespread national languages .
Costs are reduced to the same extent .
Learning Esperanto , children learn how to learn languages .
The success attained gives confidence to learners , thus facilitating the learning of further languages .
The money and time saved could be used to develop expertise in other areas , thus improving EU competitiveness .
The common bridge language would promote the development of the pan-European identity , in harmony with national and regional identities , of a truly European community .
We propose that the European=Union - adopt Esperanto ( with a special international status ) as one of its official languages ;
- recommend to member states the introduction of Esperanto as the first foreign language in the primary schools , to improve and accelerate language learning .
The European=Union could thus accomplish a historic exploit : within one generation all its citizens would be able to communicate with each=other fluently without interpreters , while safeguarding their respective mother tongues .
By presenting the Esperanto translation of the Constitutional=Treaty we would like to inform the Esperanto-speaking citizens of Europe and of the world about the values , aims and operation of the enlarged European=Union ; and furthermore to demonstrate the advantages and possibilities of the Esperanto option to the decision-makers of both our national Parliaments and the European=Union .
The vocabulary of the neutral European bridge language permits instant comprehension of much of a text even to those who have never been in contact with Esperanto .
The English and Esperanto texts have been arranged side=by=side , paragraph by paragraph .
The official English text has been taken from the Internet .

Budapest , 15 October 2005 Dr.=Lajos=Molnár Editor Recommendation The Esperanto=Association=of=Hungary ( HEA ) , joined to the European Esperanto=Union ( EEU ) at the 90th UK ( Universal Congress=of=Esperanto ) in Vilnius , Lithuania ( 23-31 July 2005 ) .
We intend to support as much as possible the actions of EEU concerning the possible and desirable role to be played by Esperanto in the multilingual European=Union .
The present translation of the Constitution of the EU demonstrates and convincingly proves that Esperanto is suitable to solve the problem of the new , Brussels=Tower=of=Babel , not in some distant and nebulous future , but in the here and now .
With the expression of sincere gratitude to all those who have contributed to it , on=behalf=of the Board of Hea=i warmly recommend this impressive and useful work .
