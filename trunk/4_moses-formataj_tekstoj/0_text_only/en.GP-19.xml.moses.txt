A Crowd in the street .
Act First .
A plainly-furnished work-room in the house of Halvard=solness .
Folding doors on the left lead out to the hall .
On the right is the door leading to the inner rooms of the house .
At the back is an open door into the draughtsmen's office .
In=front , on the left , a desk with books , papers and writing materials .
Further back than the folding door , a stove .
In the right- hand corner , a sofa , a table , and one or two chairs .
On the table a water-bottle and glass .
A smaller table , with a rocking-chair and arm-chair , in=front on the right .
Lighted lamps , with shades , on the table in the draughtmen's office , on the table in the corner , and on the desk .
In the draughtsmen's office sit Knut=brovik and his son Ragnar , occupied with plans and calculations .
At the desk in the outer office stands Kaia=fosli , writing in the ledger .
Knut=brovick is a spare old man with white hair and beard .
He wears a rather threadbare but well-brushed black coat , with spectacles , and a somewhat discoloured white neckcloth .
Ragnar=brovik is a well-dressed , light-haired man in his thirties , with a slight stoop .
Kaia=fosli is a slightly-built girl , a little over twenty , carefully dressed , and delicate-looking .
She has a green shade over her eyes .
Knut=brovik . [ Rises suddenly , as=if in distress , from the table ; breathes heavily and laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway .
] No , I can_ _n't bear it much longer ! KAIA . [ Going up=to him .
] You are feeling very ill this evening , are you not , Uncle ? Brovik . Oh , I seem to get worse every-day . Ragnar .
[ Has risen and advances . ] You ought=to go home , father .
Try to get a little sleep --
Brovik . [ Impatiently . ] Go to bed , I suppose ?
Would you have me stifled outright ?
KAIA . Then take a little walk .
Ragnar . Yes , do .
I will come with you .
Brovik . [ With warmth . ] I will not go till he comes !
I and determined to have it out this evening with -- [ in a tone of suppressed bitterness ] -- with him -- with the chief . KAIA . [ Anxiously .
] Oh no , uncle , -- do wait awhile before doing that !
Ragnar . Yes , better wait , father !
Brovik . [ Draws is breath laboriously .
] Ha -- ha -- ! _I_ have_ _n't much time for waiting .
KAIA . [ Listening . ] Hush !
I hear him on the stairs .
[ All three go back to their work .
A short silence .
Halvard=solness comes in through the hall door .
He is a man no longer young , but healthy and vigorous , with close-cut curly hair , dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows .
He wears a greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and broad lapels .
On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat , and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.
Solness .
[ Near the door , points towards the draughtsmen's office , and asks in a whisper : ] Are they gone ?
KAIA . [ Softly , shaking her ] No.
[ She takes the shade off her eyes .
Solness crosses the room , throws his hat on a chair , places the portfolios on the table by the sofa , and approaches the desk again .
KAIA goes on writing without intermission , but seems nervous and uneasy .
Solness .
[ Aloud . ] What is that you are entering , Miss=Fosli ? KAIA .
[ Starts . ] Oh , it is only something that --
Solness .
Let me look at it , Miss=Fosli . [ Bends over her , pretends to be looking into the ledger , and whispers : ] Kaia !
KAIA . [ Softly , still writing .
] Well ? Solness .
Why do you always take that shade off when I come ?
KAIA . [ As before . ] I look so ugly with it on . Solness .
[ Smiling . ] Then you do_ _n't like to look ugly , Kaia ? KAIA .
[ Half glancing up at him . ] Not for all the world .
Not in your eyes .
Solness . [ Strokes her hair gently . ] Poor , poor little Kaia -- KAIA .
[ Bending her head . ] Hush -- they can hear you !
[ Solness strolls across the room to the right , turns and pauses at the door of the draughtsmen's office .
Solness .
Has any one been here for me ? Ragnar .
[ Rising . ] Yes , the young couple who want a villa built , out at Lovstrand .
Solness . [ Growling . ] Oh , those two !
They must wait .
I am not=quite clear about the plans yet . Ragnar .
[ Advancing , with some hesitation . ] They were very anxious to have the drawings at=once . Solness .
[ As before . ] Yes , of=course -- so they all are . Brovik .
[ Looks up . ] They say they are longing so to get into a house of their own .
Solness .
Yes , yes -- we know all that !
And so they are content to take whatever is offered them .
They get a -- a roof over their heads -- an address -- but nothing to call a home .
No thank you !
In that case , let them apply to somebody=else .
Tell them that , the next time they call .
Brovik . [ Pushes his glasses up on to his forehead and looks in astonishment at him . ] To somebody=else ?
Are you prepared to give up the commission ?
Solness . [ Impatiently . ] Yes , yes , yes , devil take it !
If that is to be the way of it -- .
Rather that , than build away at random . [ Vehemently .
] Besides , I know very little about these people as-yet .
Brovik . The people are safe enough .
Ragnar knows them .
He is a friend of the family .
Solness .
Oh , safe -- safe enough !
That is not at=all what I mean .
Good lord -- do_ _n't you understand me either ? [ Angrily .
] I will_ _n't have anything to do with these strangers .
They may apply to whom they please , so=far as I am concerned .
Brovik . [ Rising .
] Do you really mean that ? Solness .
[ Sulkily . ] Yes=I do .
-- For once in a way . [ He comes forward .
[ Brovik exchanges a glance with Ragnar , who makes a warning gesture .
Then Brovik comes into the front room .
Brovik . May I have a=few words with you ? Solness .
Certainly .
Brovik . [ To KAIA . ] Just go in=there for moment , Kaia . KAIA .
[ Uneasily . ] Oh , but uncle --
Brovik . Do as I say , child .
And shut the door after you .
[ KAIA goes reluctantly into the draughtsmen's office , glances anxiously and imploringly at Solness , and shuts the door .
Brovik .
Yes , you have been looking very poorly of=late .
Brovik . It will soon be all=over with me .
My strength is ebbing -- from day to day .
Solness . Will_ _n't you sit down ?
Brovik . Thanks -- may I ?
Solness . [ Placing the arm-chair more conveniently .
] Here -- take this chair . -- And now ?
Brovik .
[ Has seated himself with difficulty .
] Well , you see , it_ _s about Ragnar .
That is what weighs most upon me . What is to become of him ?
Solness . Of=course your son will stay with me as=long=as ever he likes .
Brovik . But that is just what he does not like .
He feels that he can_ _not stay here any longer .
Solness . Why , I should say he was very well off here .
But if he wants more money , I should not mind --
Brovik . No , no !
It is not that . [ Impatiently .
] But sooner=or=later he , too , must have a chance of doing something on his own account .
No , that is just the heartbreaking part of it -- I have begun to have my doubts about the boy .
For you have never said so much as -- as one encouraging word about him .
And yet I can_ _not but think there must be something in him -- he can_ _n't be without talent .
Solness .
Well , but he has learnt nothing -- nothing thoroughly , I mean .
Except , of course , to draw .
Brovik . [ Looks at him with covert hatred , and says hoarsely .
] You had learned little enough of the business when you were in my employment .
But that did not prevent you from setting to work -- [ breathing with difficulty ] -- and pushing your way up , and taking the wind out=of my sails -- mine , and so may other people's . Solness .
Yes , you see -- circumstances favoured me .
Brovik .
You are right there .
Everything favoured you . But then how can you have the heart to let me go to my grave -- without having seen what Ragnar is fit for ?
And of=course I am anxious to see them married , too -- before I go . Solness .
[ Sharply . ] Is it she who wishes it ?
Brovik .
Not Kaia so much as Ragnar -- he talks about it every-day . [ Appealingly .
] You must help him to get some independent work now !
I must see something that the lad has done .
Do you hear ?
He has the chance of a capital commission at this very moment .
A big bit of work . Solness . [ Uneasily , startled . ] Has he ?
Brovik . I you would give your consent .
Solness . What sort of work do you mean ?
Brovik . [ With some hesitation .
] He can have the building of that villa out at Lovstrand .
Solness . That !
Why I am going to build that myself .
Brovik . Oh you do_ _n't much care about doing it .
Solness .
[ Flaring up .
] Do_ _n't care ! Who dares to say that ? Brovik .
You said so yourself just now .
Solness . Oh , never mind what I say .
-- Would they give Ragnar the building of that villa ?
Brovik . Yes .
You see , he knows the family .
And then -- just for the fun of the thing -- he has made drawings and estimates and so=forth --
Solness . Are they pleased with the drawings ?
The people who will have to live in the house ?
Brovik . Yes .
If you would only look through them and approve of them --
Solness . Then they would let Ragnar build their home for them ?
Brovik .
They were immensely pleased with his idea .
They thought it exceedingly original , they said .
Solness .
Oho !
Original ! Not the old-fashioned stuff that _I_ am in the habit of turning out !
Brovik . It seemed to them different .
Solness . [ With suppressed irritation . ] So it was to see Ragnar that they came here -- whilst I was out !
Brovik .
They came to call upon you -- and at the same time to ask whether you would mind retiring --
Solness . [ Angrily . ] Retire ?
I ?
Brovik . In=case you thought that Ragnar's drawings --
Solness . I !
Retire in favour of your son !
Brovik . Retire from the agreement , they meant . Solness .
Oh , it comes to the same thing . [ Laughs angrily .
] So=that is it , is it ?
Halvard Solness is to see about retiring now !
To make room for younger men !
For the very youngest , perhaps !
He must make room !
Room ! Room !
Brovik .
Why , good=heavens ! there is surely room for more=than one single man -- Solness .
Oh , there_ _s not so very much room to spare either .
But , be that as it may -- I will never retire !
I will never give way to anybody !
Never of my own free will .
Never in this world will I do that !
Brovik . [ Rise with difficulty .
] Then=I am to pass out=of life without any certainty ?
Without a gleam of happiness ?
Without any faith or trust in Ragnar ?
Without having seen a single piece of work of his doing ?
Is that to be the way of it ?
Solness . [ Turns half aside , and mutters .
] H'm -- do_ _n't ask more just now .
Brovik . I must have an answer to this=one question . Am I to pass out=of life in such utter poverty ?
Solness . [ Seems to struggle with himself ;
finally he says , in a low but firm voice : ] You must pass out=of life as best you can .
Brovik .
Then be it so . [ He goes up the room .
Solness . [ Following him , half is desperation .
] Do_ _n't you understand that I can_ _not help it ?
I am what I am , and I can_ _not change my nature !
Brovik . No ;
I suppose that you can_ _n't . [ Reels and supports himself against the sofa-table .
] May I have a glass of water ?
Solness . By all means . [ Fills a glass and hands it to him .
Brovik .
Thanks . [ Drinks and puts the glass down again .
[ Solness goes up and opens the door of the draughtsmen's office .
Solness .
Ragnar -- you must come and take your father home .
Ragnar rises quickly .
He and KAIA come into the work-room .
Ragnar .
What is the matter , father ?
Brovik .
Give me your arm. Now let us go . Ragnar . Very well .
You had better put your things on , too , Kaia .
Solness . Miss=Fosli must stay -- just for a moment .
There is a letter I want written .
Brovik . [ Looks at Solness . ] Good-night .
Sleep well -- if you can .
Solness . Good-night .
[ Brovik and Ragnar go out by the hall-door .
KAIA goes to the desk .
Solness stands with bent head , to the right , by the arm-chair .
KAIA .
[ Dubiously . ] Is there any letter ? Solness . [ Curtly .
] No , of=course not . [ Looks sternly at her .
] Kaia ! KAIA . [ Anxiously , in a low voice .
] Yes ! Solness .
[ Points imperatively to a spot on the floor . ] Come here ! At=once ! KAIA . [ Hesitatingly .
] Yes .
Solness . [ As before . ] Nearer !
KAIA . [ Obeying .
] What do you want with me ? Solness .
No , no , do_ _n't think that !
Solness . But confess now -- you want to get married !
And so you think it time there were an end of it .
Is not that so ?
KAIA . Ragnar and Uncle say I must .
So I suppose I shall have to give in .
Solness . [ More gently .
] Kaia , do_ _n't you really care a little bit for Ragnar , too ?
KAIA . I cared very much for Ragnar once -- before I came here to you .
Solness . But you do_ _n't now ?
Not in the least ? KAIA .
[ Passionately , clasping hands and holding them out towards him . ] Oh , you know very well there is only one-person I care for now !
I shall never care for any one else .
Solness .
Yes , you say that .
And yet you go away from me -- leave me alone here with everything on my hands .
KAIA . But could I not stay with you , even=if Ragnar -- ? Solness .
[ Repudiating the idea . ] No , no , that is quite impossible .
If Ragnar leaves me and starts work on his own account , then of=course he will need you himself . KAIA .
[ Wringing her hands . ] Oh , I feel as=if I could not be separated from you !
It_ _s quite , quite impossible ! Solness .
Then be sure you get those foolish notions out=of Ragnar's head .
Marry him as much as you please -- [ Alters his tone . ] I mean -- do_ _n't let him throw up his good situation with me .
For then I can keep you too , my dear Kaia . KAIA .
Oh yes , how lovely that would be , if it could only be managed !
Solness . [ Clasps her head with his two hands and whispers . ] For=I can_ _not get on without you , you see .
I must have you with me every single day .
KAIA . [ In nervous exaltation .
] My=God ! My=God !
Solness . [ Kisses her hair . ] Kaia -- Kaia ! KAIA .
[ Sinks down before him . ] Oh , how good you are to me !
How unspeakably good you are !
Solness . [ Vehemently .
] Get up ! For goodness' sake get up !
I think I hear some one .
[ He helps her to rise .
She staggers over to the desk .
Mrs .
Solness enters by the door on the right .
She looks thin and wasted with grief , but shows traces of bygone beauty .
Blonde ringlets .
Dressed with good taste , wholly in black .
Speaks some-what slowly and in a plaintive voice .
Mrs .
Solness . [ In the doorway . ] Halvard !
Solness . [ Turns . ] Oh , are you there , my dear -- ? Mrs .
Solness . [ With a glance at KAIA . ] I am afraid I am disturbing you . Solness .
Not in the least .
Miss=Fosli has only a short letter to write . Mrs .
Solness . Yes , so I see . Solness .
What do you want with me , Aline ? Mrs .
Solness . I merely wanted to tell you that Dr.=Herdal is in the drawing-room .
Will_ _n't you come and see him , Halvard ?
H'm -- is the doctor so very anxious to see me ? Mrs . Solness .
Well , not exactly anxious . He really came to see me ;
but he would like to say how-do-you-do to you at the same time .
Solness . [ Laughs to himself . ] Yes , I daresay .
Well , you must ask him to wait a little .
Mrs . Solness . Then you will come in presently ? Solness .
Perhaps I will . Presently , presently , dear .
In a little while . Mrs . Solness .
[ Glancing again at KAIA . ] Well now , do_ _n't forget , Halvard .
[ Withdraws and closes the door behind her . KAIA .
Oh , not in the least .
Not more=than usual at=any=rate .
But all=the=same , you had better go now , Kaia .
KAIA . Yes , yes , now I must go . Solness .
[ Severely . ] And mind you get that matter settled for me .
Do you hear ?
KAIA . Oh , if it only depended on me --
Solness . I will have it settled , I say !
And to-morrow too -- not a day later ! KAIA .
[ Terrified . ] If there_ _s nothing=else for it , I am quite willing to break off the engagement .
Solness . [ Angrily .
] Break it off . Are you mad ?
Would you think of breaking it off ? KAIA . [ Distracted .
] Yes , if=necessary .
For I must -- I must stay here with you !
I can_ _n't leave you !
That is utterly -- utterly impossible ! Solness . [ With a sudden outburst .
] But deuce take it -- how about Ragnar then !
It_ _s Ragnar that I --
KAIA . [ Looks at him with terrified eyes . ] It is chiefly on Ragnar's account , that -- that you -- ?
Solness . [ Collecting himself .
] No , no , of=course not ! You do_ _n't understand me either . [ Gently and softly .
] Of=course it is you I want to keep .
-- you above everything , Kaia .
But=for that very reason , you must prevent Ragnar , too , from throwing up his situation .
There , there , -- now go home .
KAIA . Yes , yes -- good-night , then .
Solness .
Good-night . [ As she is going .
] Oh , stop a moment ! Are=Ragnar's drawings in=there ?
KAIA . I did not see him take them with him .
Solness . Then just go and find them for me .
I might perhaps glance over them , after all . KAIA . [ Happy .
] Oh yes , please do ! Solness .
For your sake , Kaia dear .
Now , let me have them at=once , please .
[ KAIA hurries into the draughtsmen's office , searches anxiously in the table-drawer , finds a portfolio and brings it with her .
KAIA .
Here are all the drawings . Solness .
Good . Put them down there on the table .
KAIA . [ Putting down the portfolio .
] Good-night , then . [ Beseechingly . ] And please , please think kindly of me .
Solness . Oh , that I always do .
Good-night , my dear little Kaia . [ Glances to the right .
] Go , go now ! Mrs . Solness and DR .
Herdal enter by the door on the right .
He is a stoutish , elderly man , with a round , good-humoured face , clean-shaven , with thin , light hair , and gold spectacles .
Mrs .
Solness . [ Still in the doorway .
] Halvard , I can_ _not keep the doctor any longer .
Solness . Well then , come in here .
Mrs . Solness .
[ To KAIA , who is turning down the desk-lamp .
] Have you finished the letter already , Miss=Fosli ?
KAIA .
[ In confusion .
] The letter -- ?
Solness .
Yes , it was quite a short one .
Mrs . Solness .
It must have been very short . Solness .
You may go now , Miss=Fosli .
And please come in good time to-morrow morning . KAIA .
I will be sure to .
Good-night , Mrs.=Solness .
[ She goes out by the hall door .
Solness .
Are you in a hurry , doctor ?
DR . Herdal .
No , not at=all . Solness .
May I have a little chat with you ?
DR . Herdal .
With the greatest of pleasure .
Solness .
Then let us sit down . [ He motions the doctor to take the rocking-chair , and sits down himself in the arm-chair .
Herdal . Do you mean just now , when she was here ? Solness .
Yes , in her manner to me .
Did you notice anything ? DR .
Herdal . [ Smiling .
] Well , I admit -- one could_ _n't well avoid noticing that your wife -- h'm --
DR . Herdal .
-- that your wife is not particularly fond of this Miss Fosli .
Solness . Is that all ?
I have noticed that myself . DR .
Herdal . And I must say I am scarcely surprised at it . Solness .
At what ? DR .
No , no , I suppose you are right there -- and Aline too .
But it_ _s impossible to make any change . DR . Herdal .
Could you not engage a clerk ?
Solness .
The first man that came to hand ?
No , thank you -- that would never do for me . DR .
Herdal . But now , if your wife -- ?
Suppose , with her delicate health , all this tries her too much ? Solness .
Even then -- I might almost say -- it can make no difference .
I must keep Kaia=Fosli .
No=one else could fill her place . DR .
Herdal . No=one else ?
Solness . [ Curtly .
] No , no=one . DR .
Herdal . [ Drawing his chair closer .
] Now listen to me , my dear Mr.=Solness .
May I ask you a question , quite between ourselves ? Solness . By all means . DR .
Herdal . Women , you see -- in certain matters , they have a deucedly keen intuition -- Solness .
They have , indeed .
There is not the least doubt of that . But -- ?
DR . Herdal .
Well , tell me now -- if your wife can_ _n't endure this Kaia=Fosli -- ? Solness .
Well , what then ?
DR . Herdal .
-- may she not have just -- just the least little bit of reason for this instinctive dislike ?
Solness . [ Looks at him and rises . ] Oho ! DR . Herdal .
Now do_ _n't be offended -- but has_ _n't she ?
Solness . [ With curt decision .
] No. DR . Herdal .
No reason of any sort ? Solness .
No other=than her own suspicious nature . DR .
Herdal . I know you have known a good many women in your time .
Solness . Yes , I have . DR .
Herdal . And have been a good deal taken with some of them , too . Solness .
Oh yes , I do_ _n't deny it . DR .
Herdal . But as=regards Miss=Fosli , then ?
There is nothing of that sort in this case ?
Solness . No ;
nothing at=all -- on my side . DR .
Herdal . But on her side ?
Solness . I do_ _n't think you have any right to ask that question , doctor . DR . Herdal .
Well , you know , we were discussing your wife's intuition .
Solness . So we were .
there we have it ! Solness .
[ Sits down . ] Doctor Herdal -- I am going to tell you a strange story -- if you care to listen to it .
DR . Herdal .
I like listening to strange stories . Solness .
Very well then .
Herdal . Yes , so I have understood . Solness .
You see , they really are clever fellows , these two .
Each of them has talent in his own way .
But then the son took it into his head to get engaged ;
and the next thing , of=course , was that he wanted to get married -- and begin to build on his own account .
That is the way with all these young people . DR .
Just=so .
But of=course that did not suit my plans ;
for I needed Ragnar myself -- and the old man too .
Herdal . Oh yes , no doubt that_ _s indispensable . Solness .
Yes , it is .
But Ragnar was absolutely bent on setting to work for himself .
He would hear of nothing=else . DR .
Herdal . But he has stayed with you all=the=same . Solness .
Yes , I_ _ll tell you how that came about .
One day this girl , Kaia=Fosli , came to see them on some errand or other .
She had never been here before .
That was not at=all a bad idea . Solness .
Yes , but at the time I did not breathe a word of what was in my mind .
I merely stood and looked at her -- and kept on wishing intently that I could have her here .
Then I talked to her a little , in a friendly way -- about one thing and another .
And then she went away .
DR . Herdal . Well ?
An arrangement ? What about ?
Solness .
About the very thing my mind had been fixed on .
But I had_ _n't said one single word about it . DR . Herdal .
That was most extraordinary .
Solness . Yes , was it not ?
And now she wanted to know what she was to do here -- whether she could begin the very next morning , and so=forth .
DR . Herdal .
Do_ _n't you think she did it in=order=to be with her sweetheart ?
Solness . That was what occurred to me at=first .
But no , that was not it .
She seemed to drift quite away from him -- when once she had come here to me . DR .
Herdal . She drifted over to you , then ?
Solness . Yes , entirely .
If I happen to look at her when her back is turned , I can tell that she feels it .
She quivers and trembles the moment I come near her .
What do you think of that ? DR .
Herdal . H'm -- that_ _s not very hard to explain . Solness .
Well , but what about the other thing ?
That she believed I had said to her what I had only wished and willed -- silently -- inwardly -- to myself ?
What do you say to that ?
Can you explain that , Dr.=Herdal ?
DR . Herdal .
No , I will_ _n't undertake to do that . Solness .
I felt sure you would not ;
and so I have never cared to talk about it till now .
-- But it_ _s a cursed nuisance to me in the long-run , you understand .
Here have I got to go on day after day , pretending -- .
And it_ _s a shame to treat her so , too , poor girl . [ Vehemently .
] But=I can_ _not do anything=else .
For if she runs away from me -- then Ragnar will be off too . DR .
DR . Herdal .
The why on earth do_ _n't you ?
[ Shakes his head . ] I do_ _n't in the least understand what you mean . Solness .
Well , you see -- it is like paying off a little bit of a huge , immeasurable debt -- DR .
Herdal . To your wife ?
Solness . Yes ;
and that always helps to relieve one's mind a little .
One can breathe more freely for a while , you understand . DR . Herdal .
No , goodness knows , I do_ _n't understand at=all --
Solness .
[ Breaking off , rises again .
Looks at the doctor with a sly smile . ] I suppose you think you have drawn me out nicely now , doctor ?
DR . Herdal . [ With some irritation .
] Drawn you out ? Again I have not the faintest notion of what you mean , Mr.=Solness .
Solness . Oh come , out with it ;
I have seen it quite clearly , you know . DR .
Herdal . What have you seen ? Solness .
[ In a low voice , slowly . ] That you have been quietly keeping an eye upon me . DR .
Herdal . That _I_ have !
And why in all the world should I do that ?
Herdal . And what does she think about you ?
Herdal . Ill !
You !
She has never hinted such a thing to me .
Why , what can she think is the matter with you ?
Solness . [ Leans over the back of the chair and whispers . ] Aline has made up her mind that I am mad .
That is what she thinks . DR . Herdal . [ Rising . ] Why , my dear fellow -- !
Solness .
Yes , on my soul she does !
I tell you it is so .
And she has got you to think the same !
Oh , I can assure you , doctor , I see it in your face as clearly as possible .
You do_ _n't take me in so easily , I can tell you . DR .
Herdal . [ Looks at him in amazement . ] Never , Mr.=Solness -- never has such a thought entered my mind .
Solness . [ With and incredulous smile .
] Really ? Has it not ?
DR . Herdal .
No , never ! Nor your wife's mind either , I am convinced .
I could almost swear to that . Solness .
Well , I would_ _n't advise you to .
For , in a certain sense , you see , perhaps -- perhaps she is not so=far wrong in thinking something of the kind . DR .
Herdal . Come now , I really must say -- Solness .
[ Interrupting , with a sweep of his hand . ] Well , well , my dear doctor -- do_ _n't let us discuss this any further .
We had better agree to differ . [ Changes to a tone of quiet amusement .
] But look here now , doctor -- h'm -- DR . Herdal .
Well ? Solness .
Herdal . What then ? Solness .
Then I daresay you fancy that I am an extremely happy man . DR .
Herdal . Is that mere fancy ? Solness .
[ Laughs . ] No , no -- of=course not !
Heaven forbid !
Only think -- to be Solness the master builder !
Halvard=Solness !
What could be more delightful ? DR . Herdal .
[ Suppresses a gloomy smile . ] So=I have .
I can_ _n't complain on that score . DR .
Herdal . First=of=all that grim old robbers' castle was burnt down for you .
And that was certainly a great piece of luck .
Solness . [ Seriously . ] It was the home of Aline's family .
Remember that .
DR . Herdal .
Yes , it must have been a great grief to her .
Solness . She has not got over it to this day -- not in all these twelve or thirteen years .
DR . Herdal .
But you -- yourself -- you rose upon the ruins .
You began as a poor boy from a country village -- and now you are at the head of your profession .
Ah , yes , Mr.=Solness , you have undoubtedly had the luck on your side . Solness .
[ Looking at him with embarrassment . ] Yes , but that is just what makes me so horribly afraid .
DR . Herdal . Afraid ?
Because you have the luck on your side !
Solness . It terrifies me -- terrifies me every hour of the day .
For sooner=or=later the luck must turn , you see .
DR . Herdal . Oh nonsense !
What should make the luck turn ?
Solness . [ With firm assurance . ] The younger generation ! DR .
Herdal . Pooh !
The younger generation !
You are not laid on the shelf yet , I should hope .
Oh no -- your position here is probably firmer now than it has ever been .
Solness . The luck will turn .
I know it -- I feel the day approaching .
Some one or other will take it into his head to say : Give me a chance !
And then all the rest will come clamouring after him , and shake their fists at me and shout : Make room -- make room -- !
Yes , just you see , doctor -- presently the younger generation will come knocking at my door --
DR . Herdal . [ Laughing .
] Well , and what if they do ? Solness .
What if they do ?
Then there_ _s an end of Halvard=Solness .
Solness . [ Starts .
] What's that ?
Did you not hear something ?
DR . Herdal . Some one is knocking at the door . Solness .
[ Loudly . ] Come in . Hilda=wangel enters by the hall door .
She is of middle height , supple , and delicately built .
Somewhat sunburnt .
Dressed in a tourist costume , with skirt caught up for walking , a sailor's collar open at the throat , and a small sailor hat on her head .
Knapsack on back , plaid in strap , and alpenstock .
Hilda .
[ Goes straight up=to Solness , her eyes sparkling with happiness . ] Good evening !
Solness . [ Looks doubtfully at her . ] Good evening -- Hilda . [ Laughs .
] I almost believe you do_ _n't recognise me !
Solness . No -- I must admit that -- just for the moment -- DR .
Herdal . [ Approaching . ] But _I_ recognise you , my dear young lady -- Hilda .
[ Pleased . ] Oh , is it you that -- DR .
Herdal . Of=course it is . [ To Solness .
] We met at one of the mountain stations this summer . [ To Hilda .
] What became of the other ladies ? Hilda .
Oh , they went westward . DR . Herdal .
They did_ _n't much like all the fun we used to have in the evenings . Hilda .
No , I believe they did_ _n't . DR .
Well , that was better fun than to sit there knitting stockings with all those old women . DR .
Herdal . [ Laughs . ] There=I entirely agree with you !
Solness . Have you come to town this evening ? Hilda .
Yes , I have just arrived . DR .
Herdal . Quite alone , Miss=Wangel ? Hilda . Oh yes !
Solness .
Wangel ?
Is your name Wangel ?
Hilda . [ Looks in amused surprise at him . ] Yes , of=course it is .
Solness . Then you must be a daughter of the district doctor up at Lysanger ?
Hilda . [ As before .
] Yes , who else's daughter should I be ?
Solness . Oh , then I suppose we met up there , that summer when I was building a tower on the old church . Hilda . [ More seriously .
] Yes , of=course it was then we met . Solness .
Well , that is a long time ago .
Hilda . [ Looks hard at him . ] It is exactly ten years . Solness .
You must have been a mere child then , I should think .
Hilda . [ Carelessly . ] Well , I was twelve or thirteen . DR .
Herdal . Is this the first time you have ever been up=to town , Miss=Wangel ? Hilda .
Yes , it is indeed .
Solness . And do_ _n't you know any one here ?
Hilda . Nobody but you .
And of=course , your wife .
Solness . So you know her , too ?
Hilda . Only a little .
We spent a=few days together at the sanatorium .
Solness . Ah , up there ?
Hilda . She said I might come and pay her a visit if ever I came up=to town . [ Smiles .
] Not that that was necessary . Solness .
Odd that she should never have mentioned it .
[ Hilda puts her stick down by the stove , takes off the knapsack and lays it and the plaid on the sofa .
DR . Herdal offers to help her .
Solness stands and gazes at her .
Hilda .
[ Going towards him . ] Well , now I must ask you to let me stay the night here .
Solness .
I am sure there will be no difficulty about that . Hilda .
For I have no other clothes than those I stand in , except a change of linen in my knapsack .
And that has to go to the wash , for it_ _s very dirty .
Solness .
Oh yes , that can be managed .
Now I_ _ll just let my wife know -- DR .
Herdal . Meanwhile I will go and see my patient . Solness .
Yes , do ;
and come again later on .
DR . Herdal . [ Playfully , with a glance at Hilda . ] Oh that I will , you may be very certain ! [ Laughs .
] So your prediction has come true , Mr.=Solness ! Solness .
How so ? DR .
Herdal . The younger generation did come knocking at your door .
Solness . [ Cheerfully .
] Yes , but in a very different way from what I meant . DR .
Herdal .
Very different , yes . That's undeniable . [ He goes out by the hall-door .
Solness .
Aline ! Will you come in here , please .
Here is a friend of yours -- Miss Wangel .
Mrs . Solness . [ Appears in the doorway .
] Who do you say it is ? [ Sees Hilda .
] . Oh , is it you , Miss=Wangel ? Solness .
Miss=Wangel has this moment arrived ;
and she would like to stay the night here .
Mrs . Solness .
Here with us ?
Oh yes , certainly . Solness . Till she can get her things a little in order , you know .
Mrs . Solness . I will do the best I can for you .
It_ _s no=more than my duty .
I suppose your trunk is coming on later ? Hilda . I have no trunk .
Mrs . Solness .
Well , it will be all=right , I daresay .
In the meantime , you must excuse my leaving you here with my husband , until I can get a room made a little more comfortable for you .
Solness . Can we not give her one of the nurseries ?
They are all ready as it is . Mrs .
Solness . Oh yes .
There we have room and to spare . [ To Hilda .
] Sit down now , and rest a little . [ She goes out to the right .
[ Hilda , with her hands behind her back , strolls about the room and looks at various objects .
Solness stands in=front , beside the table , also with his hands behind his back , and follows her with his eyes .
Hilda .
[ Stops and looks at him . ] Have you several nurseries ? Solness .
There are three nurseries in the house . Hilda .
That's a=lot .
Then I suppose you have a great many children ?
Solness .
No. We have no child .
But now you can be the child here , for the time being .
Hilda . For to-night , yes .
I shall not cry .
I mean to sleep as sound as a stone .
Solness .
Yes , you must be very tired , I should think .
Hilda . Oh no !
But all=the=same -- .
It_ _s so delicious to lie and dream . Solness .
Do you dream much of nights ? Hilda .
Oh yes !
Almost always .
Solness . What do you dream about most ?
Hilda . I sha'n't tell you to-night .
Another time perhaps .
Solness . [ Approaching .
] Are you searching for anything ? Hilda .
No , I am merely looking at all these things . [ Turns . ] Perhaps=I must_ _n't ? Solness .
Oh , by all means . Hilda .
Is it you that writes in this great ledger ?
Solness . No , it_ _s my book-keeper . Hilda .
Is it a woman ?
Solness . [ Smiles . ] Yes . Hilda .
One you employ here , in your office ?
Solness . Yes .
Hilda . Is she married ?
Solness . No , she is single .
Hilda . Oh , indeed !
Solness . But I believe she is soon going to be married .
Hilda . That's a good thing for her .
Solness . But not such a good thing for me .
For then I shall have nobody to help me .
Hilda . Can_ _n't you get hold of some one else who will do just as=well ?
Solness . Perhaps you would stay here and -- and write in the ledger ?
Hilda . [ Measures him with a glance . ] Yes , I daresay !
No , thank you -- nothing of that sort for me .
[ She again strolls across the room , and sits down on the rocking-chair .
Solness too goes to the table .
Hilda .
[ Continuing . ] For there must surely be plenty=of other thing to be done here . [ Looks smilingly at him .
] Do_ _n't you think so , too ?
Solness . Of=course .
First=of=all , I suppose , you want to make a round of the shops , and get yourself up in the height of fashion . Hilda .
[ Amused . ] No , I think I shall let that alone !
Solness . Indeed ?
Hilda . For you must know I have run through all my money .
Solness . [ Laughs .
] Neither trunk nor money , then ?
Hilda . Neither one nor the other . But never mind -- it does_ _n't matter now .
Solness . Come now , I like you for that .
Hilda .
Only for that ? Solness .
For that among other things . [ Sits in the arm-chair . ] Is your father alive still ? Hilda .
Yes , father's alive .
Solness . Perhaps you are thinking of studying here ? Hilda .
No , that had_ _n't occurred to me .
Solness . But I suppose you will be staying for some time ? Hilda .
That must depend upon circumstances .
[ She sits awhile rocking herself and looking at him , half seriously , half with a suppressed smile .
Then she takes off her hat and puts it on the table in=front of her .
Hilda .
Mr.=Solness ! Solness .
Well ? Hilda .
Have you a very bad memory ?
Solness . A bad memory ?
No , not that I am aware of .
Hilda . Then have you nothing to say to me about what happened up there ? Solness .
[ In momentary surprise . ] Up at Lysanger ? [ Indifferently .
] Why , it was nothing much to talk about it seems to me .
Hilda . [ Looks reproachfully at him . ] How can you sit there and say such things ? Solness .
Well , then , you talk to me about it .
Hilda . When the tower was finished , we had grand doings in the town .
Solness . Yes , I shall not easily forget that day . Hilda .
[ Smiles . ] Will you not ?
That comes well from you .
Solness .
Comes well ? Hilda .
There was music in the churchyard -- and many , many hundreds of people .
We school-girls were dressed in white ;
and we all carried flags .
Solness . Ah yes , those flags -- I can tell you I remember them !
Hilda .
Then you climbed right up the scaffolding , straight to the very top ;
and you had a great wreath with you ;
and you hung that wreath right=away up on the weather-vane . Solness .
[ Curtly interrupting . ] I always did that in those days .
It is an old custom . Hilda .
It was so wonderfully thrilling to stand below and look up at you .
Fancy , if he should fall over !
He -- the master builder himself !
Solness . [ As=if to divert her from the subject . ] Yes , yes , yes , that might very will have happened , too .
[ Sparkling with pleasure . ] « Hurrah=for=Master=Builder=Solness ! »
Yes !
[ In a lower voice , seriously . ] That little devil -- that was _I_ . Solness .
[ Fixes his eyes steadily upon her . ] I am sure of that now .
It must have been you .
Hilda . [ Lively again . ] Oh , it was so gloriously thrilling !
I could not have believed there was a builder in the whole world that could build such a tremendously high tower .
And then , that you yourself should stand at the very top of it , as large as life !
And that you should not be the least bit dizzy !
It was that above everything that made one -- made one dizzy to think of .
Solness . How could you be so certain that I was not ?
Hilda . [ Scouting the idea .
] No indeed !
Oh no ! I knew that instinctively .
For if you had been , you could never have stood up there and sung . Solness .
[ Looks at her in astonishment . ] Sung ?
Did _I_ sing ?
Hilda . Yes , I should think you did .
Solness . [ Shakes his head . ] I have never sung a note in my life . Hilda .
Yes , indeed , you sang then .
It sounded like harps in the air .
Solness . [ Thoughtfully . ] This is very strange -- all this .
The real thing ? Hilda .
[ Sparking with vivacity . ] Yes , I surely do_ _n't need to remind you of that ?
Solness . Oh yes do remind me a little of that , too .
Hilda . Do_ _n't you remember that a great dinner was given in your honour at the Club ?
Solness .
Yes , to be sure .
It must have been the same afternoon , for I left the place next morning .
Hilda . And from the Club you were invited to come round to our house to supper .
Solness . Quite right , Miss=Wangel .
It is wonderful how all these trifles have impressed themselves on your mind .
Hilda . Trifles !
I like that !
Perhaps it was a trifle , too , that I was alone in the room when you came in ?
Solness . Were you alone ?
Hilda . [ Without answering him . ] You did_ _n't call me a little devil then ?
Solness . No , I suppose I did not .
Hilda . You said I was lovely in my white dress , and that I looked like a little princess .
Solness . I have no doubt you did , Miss=Wangel .
-- And besides -- I was feeling so buoyant and free that day --
Hilda . And then you said that when I grew up I should be your princess . Solness .
[ Laughing a little . ] Dear , dear -- did I say that too ?
Hilda . Yes , you did .
And when I asked how long I should have to wait , you said that you would come again in ten years -- like a troll -- and carry me off -- to Spain or some=such place .
And you promised you would buy me a kingdom there . Solness .
[ As before . ] Yes , after a good dinner one does_ _n't haggle about the halfpence .
But did I really say all that ? Hilda .
[ Laughs to herself . ] Yes .
And you told me , too , what the kingdom was to be called . Solness .
Well , what was it ?
Hilda . It was to be called the kingdom of Orangia , you said .
in the original « Appelsinia , » " appelsin « meaning » orange . " Solness . Well , that was an appetising name .
Hilda . No , I did_ _n't like it a=bit ;
for it seemed as=though you wanted to make game of me . Solness .
I am sure that can_ _not have been my intention .
Hilda . No , I should hope not -- considering what you did next --
Solness .
What in the world did I do next ?
Hilda . Well , that_ _s the finishing touch , if you have forgotten that too .
I should have thought no=one could help remembering such a thing as that . Solness .
Yes , yes , just give me a hint , and then perhaps ---- Well ?
Hilda .
[ Looks fixedly at him . ] You came and kissed me , Mr.=Solness . Solness .
[ Open-mouthed . ] _I_ did ! Hilda .
Yes , indeed you did .
You took me in both your arms , and bent my head back , and kissed me -- many times .
Solness .
Now really , my dear Miss=Wangel -- ! Hilda . [ Rises .
] You surely can_ _not mean to deny it ? Solness . Yes , I do .
I deny it altogether !
Hilda . [ Looks scornfully at him .
] Oh , indeed !
[ She turns and goes slowly up=to the stove , where she remains standing motionless , her face averted from him , her hands behind her back .
Short pause . Solness .
[ Goes cautiously up behind her .
] Miss=Wangel -- !
Solness . Do_ _n't stand there like a statue .
You must have dreamt all this . [ Lays his hand on her arm. ] Now just listen --
Hilda .
[ Makes an impatient movement with her arm. ]
Solness .
[ As a thought flashes upon him .
] Or -- !
Wait a moment !
There is something under all this , you may depend ! Hilda . [ Does not move . ]
Solness . [ In a low voice , but with emphasis . ] I must have thought all that . I must have wished it -- have willed it -- have longed to do it . And then -- .
May not that be the explanation .
Hilda . [ Is still silent . ] Solness .
[ Turns her head a little , but without looking at him . ] Then you admit it now ? Solness .
Yes -- whatever you like . Hilda .
You came and put your arms round me ?
Solness . Oh yes !
Hilda . And bent my head back ?
Solness . Very far=back . Hilda .
And kissed me ?
Solness . Yes , I did .
Hilda . Many times ? Solness .
As many as ever you like . Hilda .
[ With a slight smile . ] Yes -- just think of my forgetting such a thing as that .
Hilda . [ Again a little sulky , retreats from him .
] Oh , you have kissed so many people in your time , I suppose .
Solness . No , you must_ _n't think that of me . [ Hilda seats herself in the arm-chair .
Solness stands and leans against the rocking-chair .
Looks observantly at her . ] Miss=Wangel !
Hilda . Yes !
Solness . How was it now ?
What came of all this -- between us two .
Hilda . Why , nothing more came of it .
You know that quite well .
For then the other guests came in , and then -- bah !
Solness . Quite so !
The others came in .
To think of my forgetting that too !
Hilda . Oh , you have_ _n't really forgotten anything : you are only a=little ashamed of it all .
I am sure one does_ _n't forget things of that kind . Solness .
No , one would suppose not .
Hilda . [ Lively again , looks at him .
What day -- ? Hilda .
Yes , on what day did you hang the wreath on the tower ?
Well ?
Tell me at once !
Solness . H'm -- I confess I have forgotten the particular day .
I only know it was ten years ago .
Some time in autumn .
Hilda . [ Nods her head slowly several times . ] It was ten years ago -- on the 19th of September .
Solness .
Yes , it must have been about that time .
Fancy your remembering that too ! [ Stops .
] But wait a moment -- !
Yes -- it_ _s the 19th of September today .
Hilda . Yes , it is ;
and the ten years are gone .
And you did_ _n't come -- as you had promised me .
Solness .
Promised you ?
Threatened , I suppose you mean ? Hilda .
I do_ _n't think there was any sort of threat in that . Solness . Well then , a little bit of fun .
Hilda . Was that all you wanted ?
To make fun of me ? Solness .
Well , or to have a little joke with you .
Upon my soul , I do_ _n't recollect .
But it must have been something of that kind ;
for you were a mere child then . Hilda .
Oh , perhaps I was_ _n't quite such a child either .
Not such a mere chit as you imagine .
[ Conceals a half-teasing smile . ] Yes , indeed !
I did expect that of you .
Solness . That I should come back to your home , and take you away with me ?
Hilda . Just like a troll -- yes .
Solness . And make a princess of you ? Hilda .
That's what you promised .
Solness . And give you a kingdom as=well ? Hilda .
[ Looks up at the ceiling . ] Why not ?
Of=course it need not have been an actual , every-day sort of a kingdom . Solness .
But something=else just as good ?
Hilda . Yes , at=least as good . [ Looks at him a moment .
[ Shakes his head . ] I can_ _n't quite make you out , Miss=Wangel . Hilda .
Can you not ?
To me it seems all so simple .
Solness . No , I can_ _n't make up my mind whether you mean all you say , or are simply having a joke with me .
Hilda .
[ Smiles .
] Making fun of you , perhaps ?
I , too ?
Solness . Yes , exactly . Making fun -- of both of us . [ Looks at her .
] Is it long since you found out that I was married ?
Hilda . I have know it all along .
Why do you ask me that ? Solness .
[ Lightly . ] Oh , well , it just occurred to me . [ Looks earnestly at her , and says in a low voice . ] What have you come for ? Hilda .
I want my kingdom . The time is up .
Solness . [ Laughs involuntarily .
] What a girl you are !
Hilda . [ Gaily .
] Out with my kingdom , Mr.=Solness ! [ Raps with her fingers .
] The kingdom on the table ! Solness .
[ Pushing the rocking-chair nearer and sitting down . ] Now , seriously speaking -- what have you come for ?
What do you really want to do here ?
Hilda . Oh , first=of=all , I want to go round and look at=all the things that you have built . Solness .
That will give you plenty=of exercise . Hilda .
Yes , I know you have built a tremendous lot .
Solness . I have indeed -- especially of=late years . Hilda .
Many church-towers among the rest ?
Immensely high ones ?
Solness .
No. I build no=more church-towers now .
Nor churches either . Hilda .
What do you build then ? Solness .
Homes for human beings . Hilda .
[ Reflectively . ] Could_ _n't you build a little -- a little bit of a church-tower over these homes as=well ? Solness . [ Starting .
] What do you mean by that ? Hilda .
I mean -- something that points -- points up into the free air .
With the vane at a dizzy height . Solness .
[ Pondering a little . ] Strange that you should say that -- for that is just what I am most anxious to do . Hilda .
[ Impatiently . ] Why do_ _n't you do it , then ?
Solness . [ Shakes his head .
] No , the people will not have it . Hilda .
Fancy their not wanting it ! Solness .
[ More lightly . ] But now I am building a new home for myself -- just opposite here .
Hilda . For yourself ?
Solness .
Yes .
It is almost finished .
And on that there is a tower .
Hilda . A high tower ?
Solness . Yes .
Hilda . Very high ?
Solness . No doubt people will say it is too high -- too high for a dwelling-house .
Hilda .
I_ _ll go out to look at that tower first thing to-morrow morning .
Solness . [ Sits resting his cheek on his hand , and gazes at her .
] Tell me , Miss Wangel -- what is your name ?
Your=Christian name , I mean . Hilda .
Why , Hilda , of=course .
Solness .
[ As before . ] Hilda ?
Indeed ? Hilda .
Do_ _n't you remember that ? You called me Hilda yourself -- that day when you misbehaved .
Solness . Did I really . Hilda .
But then you said « little Hilda » ;
and I did_ _n't like that .
Solness . Oh , you did_ _n't like that , Miss=Hilda ?
Hilda .
No , not at such a time as that .
But -- « Princess Hilda » -- that will sound very well , I think . Solness .
Very well indeed .
Princess=Hilda of -- of -- what was to be the name of the kingdom ? Hilda . Pooh !
I will_ _n't have anything to do with that stupid kingdom .
I have set my heart upon quite a different one ! Solness .
[ Has leaned back in the chair , still gazing at her .
] Is_ _n't it strange -- ?
With what ?
Solness . With the effort to recover something -- some experience , which I seemed to have forgotten .
But I never had the least inkling of what it could be .
Hilda . You should have tied a knot in your pocket-handkerchief , Mr.=Solness .
Solness . In that case , I should simply have had to go racking my brains to discover what the knot could mean . Hilda .
Oh yes , I suppose there are trolls of that kind in the world , too . Solness . [ Rises slowly .
] What a good thing it is that you have come to me now . Hilda .
[ Looks deeply into his eyes . ] Is it a good thing !
Solness . For I have been so lonely here .
I have been gazing so helplessly at it all . [ In a lower voice .
] I must tell you -- I have begun to be afraid of the younger generation .
Hilda . [ With a little snort of contempt .
] Pooh -- is the younger generation something to be afraid of ? Solness . It is indeed .
And that is why I have locked and barred myself in . [ Mysteriously .
] I tell you the younger generation will one day come and thunder at my door !
They will break in upon me !
Hilda . Then I should say you ought=to go out and open the door to the younger generation . Solness .
Open the door ? Hilda .
Yes .
Let them come in to you on friendly terms , as it were .
Solness .
No , no , no !
The younger generation -- it means retribution , you see .
It comes , as=if under a new banner , heralding the turn of fortune .
Hilda . [ Rises , looks at him , and says with a quivering twitch of her lips .
Yes , you can indeed !
For you , too , come -- under a new banner it seems to me .
You marshalled against youth -- !
DR . Herdal comes in by the hall-door . DR .
Herdal . What -- you and Miss=Wangel here still ?
Solness . Yes .
We have had no end of things to talk about .
Hilda . Both old and new .
DR . Herdal .
Have you really ? Hilda .
Oh , it has been the greatest fun . For Mr.=Solness -- he has such a miraculous memory .
All the least little details he remembers instantly .
Mrs . Solness enters by the door on the right .
Mrs .
Solness . Well , Miss=Wangel , your room is quite ready for you now .
Hilda . Oh , how kind you are to me !
Solness .
[ To Mrs . Solness .
] The nursery ?
Mrs . Solness . Yes , the middle one . But first let us go in to supper .
Solness . [ Nods to Hilda . ] Hilda shall sleep in the nursery , she shall .
Mrs . Solness . [ Looks at him . ] Hilda ?
Solness . Yes , Miss=Wangel's name is Hilda .
I knew her when she was a child . Mrs .
Solness . Did you really , Halvard ?
Well , shall we go ?
[ She takes DR .
HERDAL's arm and goes out with him to the right .
Hilda has meanwhile been collecting her travelling things . Hilda .
[ Softly and rapidly to Solness . ] Is it true , what you said ? Can I be of use to you ? Solness .
[ Takes the things from her .
] You are the very being I have needed most . Hilda .
[ Looks at him with happy , wondering eyes and clasps her hands . ] But then , great heavens -- !
Solness . [ Eagerly . ] What -- ?
Hilda . Then I have my kingdom ! Solness .
[ Involuntarily . ] Hilda -- ! Hilda .
[ Again with the quivering twitch of her lips .
] Almost -- I was going to say .
[ She goes out to the right , Solness follows her .
Act Second .
A prettily furnished small drawing-room in Solness's house .
In the back , a glass-door leading out to the verandah and garden .
The right-hand corner is cut off transversely by a large bay-window , in which are flower-stands .
The left- hand corner is similarly cut off by a transverse wall , in which is a small door papered like the wall .
On each side , an ordinary door .
In=front , on the right , a console table with a large mirror over it .
Well-filled stands of plants and flowers .
In=front , on the left , a sofa with a table and chairs .
Further back , a bookcase .
Well forward in the room , before the bay window , a small table and some chairs .
It is early in the day .
Solness sits by the little table with Ragnar=brovik's portfolio open in=front of him .
He is turning the drawings over and closely examining some of them . Mrs .
Solness moves about noiselessly with a small watering-pot , attending to her flowers .
She is dressed in black as before .
Her hat , cloak and parasol lie on a chair near the mirror .
Unobserved by her , Solness now=and=again follows her with his eyes .
Neither of them speaks .
Kaia=fosli enters quietly by the door on the left .
Solness .
[ Turns his head , and says in an off-hand tone of indifference : ] Well , is that you ? KAIA .
I merely wished to let you know that I have come .
Solness . Yes , yes , that_ _s all=right .
Has_ _n't Ragnar come too ?
KAIA . No , not=yet .
He had to wait a little while to see the doctor .
But he is coming presently to hear --
Solness . How is the old man to-day ?
KAIA . Not well .
He begs you to excuse him ; he is obliged to keep his bed to-day .
Solness . Why , of=course ;
by all means let him rest . But now , get to your work . KAIA .
Yes . [ Pauses at the door .
No -- I do_ _n't know that I have anything particular to say to him .
[ KAIA goes out again to the left .
Solness remains seated , turning over the drawings .
Mrs .
Solness . [ Over beside the plants . ] I wonder if he is_ _n't going to die now , as well ? Solness . [ Looks up at her .
] As=well=as who ? Mrs . Solness .
[ Without answering .
] Yes , yes -- depend upon it , Halvard , old Brovik is going to die too .
You_ _ll see that he will .
Solness .
My dear Aline , ought you not to go out for a little walk ? Mrs .
Solness . Yes , I suppose I ought=to .
[ She continues to attend the flowers .
Solness .
[ Bending over the drawings . ] Is she still asleep ? Mrs .
Solness . [ Looking at him . ] Is it Miss=Wangel you are sitting there thinking about ?
Solness . [ Indifferently .
] I just happened to recollect her . Mrs . Solness . Miss=Wangle was up long-ago .
Solness . Oh , was she ?
Mrs . Solness . When I went in to see her , she was busy putting her things in order .
[ She goes in=front of the mirror and slowly begins to put on her hat .
Solness .
[ After a short pause . ] So we have found a use for one our nurseries after all , Aline . Mrs .
Solness . Yes , we have . Solness .
That seems to me better than to have them all standing empty . Mrs .
Solness . That emptiness is dreadful ; you are right there .
Solness .
[ Closes the portfolio , rises and approaches her . ] You will find that we shall get on far better after this , Aline .
Things will be more comfortable . Life will be easier -- especially for you . Mrs . Solness .
[ Looks at him .
] After this ?
Solness .
Yes , believe me , Aline -- Mrs .
Solness . Do you mean -- because she has come here ? Solness .
Solness . [ Takes her cloak . ] Ah , do you think so , Halvard ?
Will it be better then ?
Solness . I can_ _n't think otherwise .
And surely you think so too ? Mrs .
Solness . I think nothing at=all about the new house . Solness .
[ Cast down . ] It_ _s hard for me to hear you say that ;
for you know it is mainly for your sake that I have built it .
[ He offers to help her on with her cloak .
Mrs .
Solness . [ Evades him . ] The fact is , you do far too much for my sake . Solness .
[ With a certain vehemence . ] No , no , you really must_ _n't say that , Aline !
I can_ _not bear to hear you say such things ! Mrs .
Solness . Very well , then I will_ _n't say it , Halvard .
Solness . But I stick to what _I_ said .
You_ _ll see that things will be easier for you in the new place . Mrs .
Solness . Oh , heavens -- easier for me -- !
Solness . [ Eagerly .
] Yes , indeed they will !
You may be quite sure of that !
[ In a low voice . ] Yes , yes , my poor Aline .
That was a terrible blow for you . Mrs .
Solness . We are not in the habit of talking about it .
For you always put the thought away from you --
Solness . [ Stops suddenly and looks at her . ] Do=I ?
And why should I do that ?
Put the thought away from me ? Mrs . Solness .
Oh yes , Halvard , I understand you very well .
You are so anxious to spare me -- and to find excuses for me too -- as much as ever you can . Solness . [ With astonishment in his eyes . ] You !
Is it you -- yourself , that your are talking about , Aline ?
Mrs . Solness .
Yes , who=else should it be but myself ? Solness .
[ Involuntarily to himself . ] That too !
Mrs . Solness .
As=for the old house , I would_ _n't mind so much about that .
When once misfortune was in the air -- why -- Solness .
Ah , you are right there .
Misfortune will have its way -- as the saying goes . Mrs .
Solness . But it_ _s what came of the fire -- the dreadful thing that followed -- ! That is the thing ! That , that , that !
Solness .
[ Vehemently .
] Do_ _n't think about that , Aline ! Mrs .
Solness . Ah , that is exactly what I can_ _not help thinking about .
And now , at=last , I must speak about it , too ;
for I do_ _n't seem to be able to bear it any longer .
And then never to be able to forgive myself --
Solness . [ Exclaiming .
] Yourself -- !
Mrs . Solness .
Yes , for I had duties on=both=sides -- both towards you and towards the little ones .
I ought=to have hardened myself -- not to have let the horror take such hold upon me -- nor the grief for the burning of my home . [ Wrings her hands .
] Oh , Halvard , if I had only had the strength ! Solness .
[ Softly , much moved , comes closer . ] Aline -- you must promise me never to think these thoughts any=more .
-- Promise me that , dear !
Mrs . Solness . Oh , promise , promise !
One can promise anything . Solness .
[ Clenches his hands and crosses the room .
] Oh , but this is hopeless , hopeless !
Never a ray of sunlight !
Not so much as a gleam of brightness to light up our home ! Mrs .
Solness . This is no home , Halvard .
Solness .
Oh no , you may well say that . [ Gloomily .
Solness . It will never be any better .
Just as empty -- just as desolate -- there as here .
Solness .
[ Vehemently .
] Why in all the world have we built it then ?
Can you tell me that ?
Mrs . Solness . No ; you must answer that question for yourself .
Solness . [ Glances suspiciously at her .
] What do you mean by that , Aline ? Mrs .
Solness . What do I mean ? Solness . Yes , in the devil's name !
You said it so strangely -- as=if you had some hidden meaning in it .
Mrs . Solness .
No , indeed , I assure you -- Solness .
[ Comes closer . ] Oh , come now -- I know what I know .
I have both my eyes and my ears about me , Aline -- you may depend upon that ! Mrs .
Solness .
Why , what are you talking about ?
What is it ? Solness .
Solness . _I_ do you say ?
_I_ do that ?
Solness . [ Laughs . ] Ho-ho-ho !
It_ _s natural enough , Aline !
When you have a sick man on your hands -- Mrs .
Solness . [ Anxiously .
] Sick ? Are you ill , Halvard ?
Solness . [ Violently .
] A half-mad man then !
A crazy man ! Call me what you will .
Mrs . Solness . [ Feels blindly for a chair and sits down .
] Halvard -- for God's sake -- Solness .
But you are wrong , both you and the doctor .
I am not in the state that you imagine .
[ He walks up=and=down the room .
Mrs . Solness follows him anxiously with her eyes .
Finally he goes up=to her .
Solness .
[ Calmly . ] In reality there is nothing whatever the matter with me . Mrs . Solness .
No , there is_ _n't , is there ?
But then what is it that troubles you so ?
Solness . Why this , that I often feel ready to sink under this terrible burden of debt -- Mrs .
Solness . Debt , do you say ?
But you owe no=one anything , Halvard ! Solness .
[ Softly , with emotion . ] I owe a boundless debt to you -- to you -- to you , Aline .
Mrs . Solness . [ Rises slowly .
] What is behind all this ?
You may just as=well tell me at once .
Solness . But there is nothing behind it !
I have never done you any wrong -- not wittingly and willfully , at=any=rate .
And yet -- and yet it seems as though a crushing debt rested upon me and weighed me down .
Mrs . Solness .
A debt to me ? Solness .
Chiefly to you . Mrs . Solness . Then you are -- ill after all , Halvard .
Solness .
[ Gloomily .
] I suppose I must be -- or not far from it . [ Looks towards the door to the right , which is opened at this moment .
] Ah !
now it grows light .
Hilda=wangel comes in .
She has made some alteration in her dress , and let down her skirt .
Hilda .
Good morning , Mr.=Solness !
Solness . [ Nods .
] Slept well ? Hilda .
Quite deliciously !
Like a child in a cradle . Oh -- I lay and stretched myself like -- like a princess !
Solness . [ Smiles a little .
] You were thoroughly comfortable then ? Hilda .
I should think so . Solness . And no doubt you dreamed , too .
Hilda . Yes , I did .
But that was horrid .
Solness . Was it ? Hilda .
Yes , for I dreamed I was falling over a frightfully high , sheer precipice .
Do you never have that kind of dream ?
Solness . Oh yes -- now=and=then --
Hilda . It_ _s tremendously thrilling -- when you fall and fall -- Solness .
It seems to make one's blood run cold . Hilda .
Do you draw your legs up under you while you are falling ?
Solness . Yes , as high as ever I can .
Hilda . So do I . Mrs . Solness . [ Takes her parasol .
] I must go into town now , Halvard . [ To Hilda . ] And I_ _ll try to get one or two things that you may require .
Hilda . [ Making a motion to throw her arms round her neck .
] Oh , you dear , Mrs. Solness !
You are really much too kind to me !
Frightfully kind --
Mrs . Solness . [ Deprecatingly , freeing herself . ] Oh , not at=all .
It_ _s only my duty , so I am very glad to do it .
Hilda . [ Offended , pouts .
] But really , I think I am quite fit to be seen in the streets -- now that I_ _ve put my dress to rights .
Or do you think I am not ? Mrs .
Solness . To tell you the truth , I think people would stare at you a little . Hilda .
[ Contemptuously .
] Pooh ! Is that all ?
That only amuses me .
Solness . [ With suppressed ill-humour . ] Yes , but people might take it into their heads that you were mad too , you see .
Hilda . Mad ?
Are there so many mad people here in-town , then ?
Solness . [ Points to his own forehead . ] Here you see one at all events .
Hilda . You -- Mr.=Solness !
Solness .
Have you not noticed that yet ?
Hilda .
No , I certainly have not . [ Reflects and laughs a little .
] And yet -- perhaps in one single thing . Solness .
Ah , do you hear that , Aline ? Mrs .
Solness . What is that one single thing , Miss=Wangel ?
Hilda . No , I will_ _n't say .
Solness . Oh yes , do !
Hilda . No thank you -- I am not so mad as that . Mrs .
Solness . When you and Miss=Wangel are alone , I daresay she will tell you , Halvard .
Solness . Ah -- you think she will ? Mrs .
Solness . Oh yes , certainly . For you have known her so well in the past .
Ever since she was a child -- you tell me .
[ She goes out by the door on the left .
Hilda .
[ After a little while . ] Does your wife dislike me very much ? Solness .
Did you think you noticed anything of the kind ?
Hilda . Did you notice it yourself ?
Solness . [ Evasively . ] Aline has become exceedingly shy with strangers of=late years .
Hilda . Has she really ?
Solness . But if only you could get to know her thoroughly -- !
Ah , she is so good -- so kind -- so excellent a creature -- Hilda .
[ Impatiently . ] But if she is all that -- what made her say that about her duty ?
Solness . Her duty ?
She said that she would go out and buy something for me , because it was her duty .
Oh , I can_ _n't bear that ugly , horrid word !
Solness . Why not ?
Hilda . It sounds so could and sharp , and stinging .
Duty -- duty -- duty .
Do_ _n't you think so , too ? Does_ _n't it seem to sting you ?
Solness . H'm -- have_ _n't thought much about it . Hilda .
Yes , it does .
But , good Lord , what would you have had her say , then ?
Hilda . She might have said she would do it because she had taken a tremendous fancy to me .
She might have said something like that -- something really warm and cordial , you understand .
Solness . [ Looks at her .
] Is that how you would like to have it ?
Hilda . Yes , precisely . [ She wanders about the room , stops at the bookcase and looks at the books .
] What a=lot=of books you have . Solness .
Yes , I have got together a good many .
Hilda . Do you read them all , too ?
Solness . I used to try to .
Do you read much ?
Hilda .
No , never !
I have given it up .
For it all seems so irrelevant . Solness .
That is just my feeling . [ Hilda wanders about a little , stops at the small table , opens the portfolio and turns over the contents .
Hilda . Are all these your drawings yours ?
Solness . No , they are drawn by a young man whom I employ to help me .
Hilda . Some one you have taught ?
Solness . Oh yes , no doubt he has learnt something from me , too . Hilda . [ Sits down .
] Then=I suppose he is very clever . [ Looks at a drawing .
] Is_ _n't he ? Solness .
Oh , he might be worse .
For my purpose --
Hilda . Oh yes -- I_ _m sure he is frightfully clever .
Solness .
Do you think you can see that in the drawings ?
Hilda . Pooh -- these scrawlings !
But if he has been learning from you --
Solness .
Oh , so=far as that goes -- there are plenty=of people here that have learnt from me , and have come to little enough for=all=that . Hilda .
[ Looks at him and shakes her head .
] No , I can_ _n't for the life of me understand how you can be so stupid .
Solness . Stupid ?
Do you think I am so very stupid ?
Hilda . Yes , I do indeed .
If you are content to go about here teaching all these people --
Solness . [ With a slight start .
] Well , and why not ?
Hilda . [ Rises , half serious , half laughing .
] No indeed , Mr.=Solness !
What can be the good of that ?
No=one but you should be allowed to build .
You should stand quite alone -- do it all yourself .
Now you know it .
Solness . [ Involuntarily . ] Hilda -- ! Hilda .
Well !
Solness . How in the world did that come into your head ?
Hilda . Do you think I am so very far wrong then ? Solness .
No , that_ _s not what I mean .
But now I_ _ll tell you something .
Hilda . Well ?
Solness . I keep on -- incessantly -- in silence and alone -- brooding on that very thought .
Hilda . Yes , that seems to me perfectly natural . Solness .
[ Looks somewhat searchingly at her . ] Perhaps you have noticed it already ? Hilda .
No , indeed I have_ _n't .
Solness . But just now -- when you said you thought I was -- off my balance ?
In one thing , you said --
Hilda . Oh , I was thinking of something quite different . Solness .
What was it ? Hilda .
I am not going to tell you . Solness . [ Crosses the room .
] Well , well -- as you please . [ Stops at the bow-window .
[ Approaching . ] What is it ? Solness .
Do you see over here in the garden -- ?
Hilda . Yes ?
Solness . [ Points . ] Right above the great quarry -- ?
Hilda . That new house , you mean ?
Solness . The one that is being built , yes .
Almost finished .
Hilda . It seems to have a very high tower . Solness .
The scaffolding is still up .
Hilda . Is that your new house ?
Solness . Yes . Hilda . The house you are soon going to move into ? Solness . Yes .
Hilda . [ Looks at him . ] Are there nurseries in that house , too ? Solness .
Three , as there are here . Hilda .
And no child . Solness . And there never will be one .
Hilda . [ With a half-smile .
] Well , is_ _n't it just as I said -- ? Solness .
That -- ? Hilda .
That you are a little -- a=little mad after all .
Solness . Was that what you were thinking of ?
Hilda . Yes , of all the empty nurseries I slept in . Solness .
[ Lowers his voice . ] We have had children -- Aline and I .
Hilda . [ Looks eagerly at him .
] Have you -- ? Solness .
Two little boys . They were of the same age .
Hilda . Twins , then .
Solness . Yes , twins . It_ _s eleven or twelve years ago now . Hilda . [ Cautiously . ] And so both of them -- ?
You have lost both the twins , then ?
Solness .
[ With quiet emotion .
] We kept them only about three weeks .
Or scarcely so much . [ Bursts forth .
] Oh , Hilda , I can_ _n't tell you what a good thing it is for me that you have come !
For now at=last I have some one to talk to !
Hilda . Can you not talk to -- her , too ?
Solness . Not about this .
Not as I want to talk and must talk . [ Gloomily .
] And not about so many=other things , either .
Hilda . [ In a subdued voice .
] Was that all you meant when you said you need me ?
Solness .
That was mainly what I meant -- at all events , yesterday .
For to-day I am not so sure -- [ Breaking off .
] Come here and let us sit down , Hilda .
Sit there on the sofa -- so=that you can look into the garden . [ Hilda seats herself in the corner of the sofa . Solness brings a chair closer . ] Should you like to hear about it ? Hilda .
Yes , I shall love to sit and listen to you .
Solness . [ Sits down . ] Then=I will tell you all about it .
Hilda . Now I can see both the garden and you , Mr.=Solness .
So now , tell away !
Begin !
Yes ? Solness .
Aline and I lived there in the first years of our married life .
There was an old house up there that had belonged to her mother ;
and we inherited it , and the whole of the great garden with it . Hilda .
Was there a tower on that house , too ?
Solness . No , nothing of the kind .
From the outside it looked like a great , dark , ugly wooden box ;
but all=the=same , it was snug and comfortable enough inside . Hilda .
Then did you pull down the ramshackle old place ?
Solness . No , it was burnt down .
Hilda . The whole of it ?
Solness .
Yes . Hilda .
Was that a great misfortune for you ? Solness .
That depends on how you look at it .
As a builder , the fire was the making of me -- Hilda .
Well , but --
Solness . It was just after the birth of the two little boys --
Hilda . The poor little twins , yes .
Solness . They came healthy and bonny into the world .
And they were growing too -- you could see the difference day to-day .
Hilda . Little children do grow quickly at=first .
Solness . It was the prettiest sight in the world to see Aline lying with the two of them in her arms .
-- But then came the night of the fire --
Hilda . [ Excitedly .
] What happened ? Do tell me !
Was any one burnt ?
Solness .
No , not that .
Every one got safe and sound out=of the house -- Hilda .
Well , and what then -- ?
Solness . The fright had shaken Aline terribly .
The alarm -- the escape -- the break-neck hurry -- and then the ice-cold night air -- for they had to be carried out just as they lay -- both she and the little ones .
Hilda . Was it too much for them ?
Solness .
Oh no , they stood it well enough .
But Aline fell into a fever , and it affected her milk .
She would insist on nursing them herself ;
because it was her duty , she said .
And both our little boys , they -- [ Clenching his hands . ] -- they -- oh !
Hilda . They did not get over that ?
Solness . No , that they did not get over .
That was how we lost them . Hilda .
It must have been terribly hard for you .
Solness . Hard enough for me ;
but ten time harder for Aline . [ Clenching his hands in suppressed fury .
] Oh , that such things should be allowed to happen here the world ! [ Shortly and firmly .
Did you not like building the church-tower in our town ? Solness .
I did_ _n't like it .
I know how free and happy I felt when that tower was finished .
Hilda . _I_ know that , too .
Solness . And now I shall never -- never build anything of that sort again !
Neither churches nor church-towers .
Hilda . [ Nods slowly . ] Nothing but houses for people to live in .
Solness . Homes for human beings , Hilda .
Hilda . But homes with high towers and pinnacles upon them .
Solness .
If=possible . [ Adopts a lighter tone .
] But , as I said before , that fire was the making of me -- as a builder , I mean . Hilda .
Why do_ _n't you call yourself an architect , like the others ? Solness .
I have not been systematically enough taught for that .
Most of what I know I have found out for myself .
Hilda . But you succeeded all=the=same . Solness .
Yes , thanks=to the fire .
I laid out almost the whole of the garden in villa lots ;
and there I was able to build after my own heart .
So I came to the front with a rush .
Hilda . [ Looks keenly at him . ] You must surely be a very happy man , as matters stand with you .
Solness .
[ Gloomily . ] Happy ?
Do you say that , too -- like all the rest of them ?
Hilda .
Yes , I should say you must be .
If you could only cease thing about the two little children -- Solness .
[ Somewhat uncertainly . ] Do you still feel their loss so much -- after all these years ?
Solness .
[ Looks fixedly at her , without replying . ] A happy man you said -- Hilda .
Well , now , are you not happy -- in other respects ? Solness .
Well ? Solness .
Was there not one special thought that you -- that you seized upon ? Hilda .
[ Reflects in vain . ] No. What thought should that be ?
Solness . [ With subdued emphasis .
] It was simply and solely by that fire that I was enabled to build homes for human beings .
Cosy , comfortable , bright homes , where father and mother and the whole troop of children can live in safety and gladness , feeling what a happy thing it is to be alive in the world -- and most=of=all to belong to each=other -- in great things and in small .
Hilda . [ Ardently .
The price , Hilda !
The terrible price I had to pay for the opportunity !
Hilda . But can you never get over that ?
Solness .
No. That=I might build homes for others , I had to forego -- to forego for all time -- the home that might have been my own .
I mean a home for a troop of children -- and for father and mother , too . Hilda .
[ Cautiously . ] But need you have done that ?
For all-time , you say ?
Solness . [ Nods slowly . ] That was the price of this happiness that people talk about . [ Breathes heavily .
] This happiness -- h'm -- this happiness was not to be bought any cheaper , Hilda .
Hilda . [ As before .
] But may it not come right even yet ?
Solness .
Never in this world -- never .
That is another consequence of the fire -- and of Aline's illness afterwards .
Hilda . [ Looks at him with an indefinable expression . ] And yet you build all these nurseries . Solness . [ Seriously .
] Have you never noticed , Hilda , how the impossible -- how it seems to beckon and cry aloud to one ? Hilda . [ Reflecting .
] The impossible ? [ With animation .
] Yes , indeed !
Is that how you feel too ?
Solness . Yes , I do . Hilda .
Then there must be -- a little of the troll in you too .
Solness . Why of the troll ?
Hilda . What would you call it , then ?
Solness . [ Rises . ] Well , well , perhaps you are right . [ Vehemently .
] But how can I help turning into a troll , when this is how it always goes with me in everything -- in everything !
Hilda .
How do you mean ?
Solness . [ Speaking low , with inward emotion . ] Mark what I say to you , Hilda .
All that I have succeeded in doing , building , creating -- all the beauty , security , cheerful comfort -- ay , and magnificence too -- [ Clenches his hands .
] Oh , is it not terrible even to think of -- ?
Hilda .
What is so terrible ?
Solness .
That all this I have to make up for , to pay for -- not in money , but in human happiness .
And not with my own happiness only , but with other people's too .
Yes , yes , do you see that , Hilda ?
That is the price which my position as an artist has cost me -- and others . And every single day I have to look on while the price is paid for me anew .
Over again , and over again -- and over again for=ever !
Hilda . [ Rises and looks steadily at him . ] Now=I can see that you are thinking of -- of her .
Solness .
Yes , mainly of Aline .
For Aline -- she , too , had her vocation in life , just as=much=as I had mine . [ His voice quivers .
] But her vocation has had to be stunted , and crushed , and shattered -- in=order=that mine might force its way to -- to a sort of great victory .
For you must know that Aline -- she , too , had a talent for building .
Hilda . She !
For building ?
Well , but what then ?
Solness . [ Softly , with emotion .
] For building up the souls of little children , Hilda .
For building up children's souls in perfect balance , and in noble and beautiful forms .
For enabling them to soar up into erect and full-grown human souls .
That was Aline's talent .
And there it all lies now -- unused and unusable for=ever -- of no earthly service to any one -- just like the ruins left by a fire .
Hilda . Yes , but even=if this were so -- ?
Solness . It is so !
It is so !
I know it !
Hilda . Well , but in any case it is not your fault . Solness .
[ Fixes his eyes on her , and nods slowly . ] Ah , that is the great , the terrible question .
That is the doubt that is gnawing me -- night and day .
Hilda . That ?
Solness . Yes . Suppose the fault was mine -- in a certain sense . Hilda .
Your fault !
The fire !
Solness .
All of it ;
the whole thing .
And yet , perhaps -- I may not have had anything to do with it . Hilda .
H'm -- I do_ _n't think I shall ever be of quite sound mind on that point .
Hilda comes forward .
Ragnar . [ When he sees Hilda .
] Oh .
I beg pardon , Mr.=Solness ---- [ He makes a movement to withdraw . Solness . No , no , do_ _n't go .
Let us get it over .
Ragnar . Oh , yes -- if only we could .
Solness . I hear your father is no better ?
Ragnar .
Father is fast growing weaker -- and therefore I beg and implore you to write a=few kind words for me on one of the plans !
Something for father to read before he --
Solness . [ Vehemently . ] I will_ _n't hear anything more about those drawings of yours !
Ragnar .
Have you looked at them ?
Solness . Yes -- I have . Ragnar . And they are good for nothing ?
And _I_ am good for nothing , too ?
Solness . [ Evasively .
] Stay here with me , Ragnar .
You shall have everything your own way .
And then you can marry Kaia , and live at your ease -- and happily too , who knows ?
Only do_ _n't think of building on your own account .
Ragnar . Well , well , then I must go home and tell father what you say -- I promised I would .
-- Is this what I am to tell father -- before he dies ?
Solness . [ With a groan .
] Oh tell him -- tell him what you will , for me .
Best to say nothing at=all to him ! [ With a sudden outburst .
] I can_ _not do anything else , Ragnar ! Ragnar .
May I have the drawings to take with me ? Solness .
Yes , take them -- take them by all means !
They are lying there on the table .
Ragnar .
[ Goes to the table . ] Thanks . Hilda .
[ Puts her hand on the portfolio . ] No , no ; leave them here . Solness . Why ?
Hilda . Because I want to look at them , too .
Solness . But you have been ---- [ To Ragnar .
] Well , leave them here , then . Ragnar . Very well .
Solness . And go home at=once to your father . Ragnar .
Yes , I suppose I must .
Solness . [ As=if in desperation . ] Ragnar -- you must not ask me to do what is beyond my power !
Do you hear , Ragnar ?
You must not !
Ragnar .
No , no. I beg you pardon -- [ He bows , and goes out by the corner door .
Hilda . [ Looks angrily at Solness .
] That was a very ugly thing to do .
Solness . Do you think so , too ?
Hilda . Yes , it was horribly ugly -- and hard and bad and cruel as=well .
Solness . Oh , you do_ _n't understand my position . Hilda .
No=matter -- .
I say you ought not to be like that .
Solness . You said yourself , only just now , that no=one but _I_ ought=to be allowed to build .
Hilda .
_I_ may say such things -- but you must not .
Solness .
I most=of=all , surely , who have paid so dear for my position .
And with my peace of soul into the bargain .
Hilda . [ Rising . ] Peace of soul ! [ With feeling .
] Yes , yes , you are right in that !
Poor Mr.=Solness -- you fancy that -- Solness .
[ With a quiet , chuckling laugh . ] Just sit down again , Hilda , and I_ _ll tell you something funny .
Hilda . [ Sits down ;
with intent interest . ] Well ? Solness .
It sounds such a ludicrous little thing ;
for , you see , the whole story turns upon nothing but a crack in the chimney . Hilda .
No=more than that ?
Solness . No , not to=begin=with .
[ He moves a chair nearer to Hilda and sits down .
Hilda .
[ Impatiently , taps on her knee . ] Well , now for the crack in the chimney ! Solness .
I had noticed the split in the flue long , long=before the fire .
Every time I went up into the attic , I looked to see if it was still there .
Hilda . And it was ?
Solness . Yes ;
for no=one else knew about it .
Hilda . And you said nothing ?
Solness . Nothing .
Hilda . And did not think of repairing the flue either ? Solness .
Oh yes , I thought about it -- but never got any further .
Every time I intended to set to work , it seemed just as=if a hand held me back .
Not to-day , I thought -- to-morrow ;
and nothing ever came of it . Hilda .
But why did you keep putting it off like that ?
Solness . Because I was revolving something in my mind . [ Slowly , and in a low voice .
] Through that little black crack in the chimney , I might , perhaps , force my way upwards -- as a builder .
Hilda . [ Looking straight in=front of her .
] That must have been thrilling .
Solness .
Almost irresistible -- quite irresistible . For at that time it appeared to me a perfectly simple and straightforward matter .
I would have had it happen in the winter-time -- a little before midday .
I was to be out driving Aline in the sleigh .
The servants at home would have made huge fires in the stoves . Hilda .
For , of=course , it was to be bitterly cold that day ?
Solness . Rather biting , yes -- and they would want Aline to find it thoroughly snug and warm when she came home .
Hilda . I suppose she is very chilly by nature ?
Solness . She is .
And as we drove home , we were to see the smoke .
Hilda .
Only the smoke ? Solness .
The smoke first . But when we came up=to the garden gate , the whole of the old timber-box was to be a rolling mass of flames .
-- That is how I wanted it to be , you see .
Hilda . Oh , why , why could it not have happened so ! Solness .
You may well say that , Hilda .
Hilda . Well , but now listen , Mr.=Solness .
Are you perfectly certain that the fire was caused by that little crack in the chimney !
Solness .
No , on=the=contrary -- I am perfectly certain that the crack in the chimney had nothing whatever to do with the fire .
Hilda . What !
Then what is all this nonsense you are talking about the crack in the chimney ! Solness .
May I go on talking to you a little , Hilda ? Hilda .
Yes , if you_ _ll only talk sensibly --
Solness .
I will try to . [ He moves his chair nearer .
Hilda . Out with it , then , Mr.=Solness .
Solness . [ Confidentially . ] Do_ _n't you agree with me , Hilda , that there exist special , chosen people who have been endowed with the power and faculty if desiring a thing , craving for a thing , willing a thing -- so persistently and so -- so inexorably -- that at=last it has to happen ?
Do_ _n't you believe that ?
Hilda . [ With an indefinable expression in her eyes . ] If that is so , we shall see , one of these days , whether _I_ am one of the chosen .
Solness . It is not one's self alone that can do such great things .
Oh , no -- the helpers and the servers -- they must do their part too , if it is to be of any good .
But they never come of themselves .
One has to call upon them very persistently -- inwardly , you understand .
Hilda . What are these helpers and servers ? Solness .
Oh , we can talk about that some=other time .
For the present , let us keep to this business of the fire .
Hilda . Do_ _n't you think that fire would have happened all=the=same -- even without your wishing for it ?
Solness . If the house had been old Knut=Brovik's , it would never have burnt down so conveniently for him .
I am sure of that ;
for he does not know how to call for the helpers -- no , nor for the servers , either . [ Rises in unrest .
] So you see , Hilda -- it is my fault , after all , that the lives of the two little boys had to be sacrificed .
And do you think it is not my fault , too , that Aline has never been the woman she should and might have been -- and that she most longed to be ?
Hilda .
Yes , but if it is all the work of these helpers and servers -- ?
Solness . Who called for the helpers and servers ?
It was I !
And they came and obeyed my will . [ In increasing excitement .
] That is what people call having the luck on your side ;
but I must tell you what this sort of luck feels like !
It feels like a great raw place here on my breast .
And the helpers and servers keep on flaying pieces of skin off other people in order to close my sore !
-- But still the sore is not healed -- never , never !
Oh , if you knew how it can sometimes gnaw and burn ! Hilda .
[ Looks attentively at him . ] You are ill , Mr.=Solness .
Very ill , I almost think .
Solness .
Say mad ;
for that is what you mean .
Hilda .
No , I do_ _n't think there is much amiss with your intellect .
Solness . With what then ?
Out with it ! Hilda .
I wonder whether you were not sent into the world with a sickly conscience . Solness .
A sickly conscience ?
What devilry is that ?
Hilda . I mean that your conscience is feeble -- too delicately built , as it were -- has_ _n't strength to take a grip of things -- to lift and bear what is heavy . Solness .
[ Growls . ] H'm !
May I ask , then , what sort of a conscience one ought=to have ?
Hilda . I should like your conscience to be -- to be thoroughly robust .
Solness .
Indeed ?
Robust , eh ?
Is your own conscience robust , may I ask ?
Hilda . Yes , I think it is .
I have never noticed that it was_ _n't .
Solness . It has not been put very severely to the test , I should think . Hilda .
[ With a quivering of the lips . ] Oh , it was no=such simple matter to leave father -- I am so awfully fond of him .
Solness . Dear me !
for a month or two --
Hilda . I think I shall never go home again .
Solness . Never ?
Then why did you leave him ?
Hilda . [ Half-seriously , half-banteringly . ] Have you forgotten again that the ten-year are up ?
Solness . Oh nonsense .
Was anything wrong at-home ?
Eh ?
Hilda . [ Quite seriously . ] It was this impulse within me that urged and goaded me to come -- and lured and drew me on , as=well .
Solness . [ Eagerly .
] There we have it !
There we have it , Hilda !
There is the troll in you too , as=in me .
For it_ _s the troll in one , you see -- it is that that calls to the powers outside us .
And then you must give in -- whether you will or no.
Hilda . I almost think you are right , Mr.=Solness . Solness .
Devils , too ? Solness .
[ Stops . ] Good devils and bad devils ;
light-haired devils and black-haired devils .
If only you could always tell whether it is the light or dark ones that have got hold of you ! [ Paces about . ] Ho-ho !
Then it would be simple enough ! Hilda .
[ Follows him with her eyes .
] Or if one had a really vigorous , radiantly healthy conscience -- so=that one dared to do what one would .
Solness . [ Stops beside the console table .
I should_ _n't wonder .
Solness . [ Leaning against the table . ] In the sagas -- .
Have you read any of the old sagas ? Hilda .
Oh yes !
When I used to read books , I -- Solness .
And carried off women -- Solness .
-- and kept them in captivity --
Hilda . -- took them home in their ships --
Solness . -- and behaved to them like -- like the very worst of trolls .
Hilda . [ Looks straight before her , with a half-veiled look .
] I think that must have been thrilling . Solness . [ With a short , deep laugh .
] To carry off women , eh ?
Hilda . To be carried off . Solness .
[ Looks at her a moment . ] Oh , indeed . Hilda . [ As=if breaking the thread of the conversation .
] But what made you speak of these vikings , Mr.=Solness ? Solness .
Why , those fellows must have had robust consciences , if you like !
When they got home again , they could eat and drink , and be as happy as children .
And the women , too !
They often would not leave them on any account .
Can you understand that , Hilda ?
Hilda . Those women I can understand exceedingly well .
Solness . Oho !
Perhaps you could do the same yourself ?
Hilda . Why not ?
Solness . Live -- of your own free will -- with a ruffian like that ?
Hilda . If it was a ruffian I had come to love --
Solness . Could you come to love a man like that ?
[ Half-laughing . ] And all those blessed devils , that you know so well -- both the light-haired and the dark-haired ones .
Solness . [ Quietly and warmly .
For me they have chosen already -- once=and=for=all .
Solness .
[ Looks earnestly at her . ] Hilda -- you are like a wild bird of the woods . Hilda .
Far from it .
I do_ _n't hide myself away under the bushes .
Solness .
No , no. There is rather something of the bird of prey in you . Hilda .
That is nearer it -- perhaps . [ Very vehemently .
] And why not a bird of prey ?
Why should not _I_ go a-hunting -- I , as=well=as the rest ?
Carry off the prey I want -- if only I can get my claws into it , and do with it as I will .
Solness .
Hilda -- do you know what you are ? Hilda .
Yes , I suppose I am a strange sort of bird .
Solness .
No. You are like a dawning day .
When I look at you -- I seem to be looking towards the sunrise . Hilda .
Tell me , Mr.=Solness -- are you certain that you have never called me to you ?
Inwardly , you know ? Solness . [ Softly and slowly .
] I almost think I must have . Hilda .
What did you want with me ?
Solness . You are the younger generation , Hilda . Hilda .
[ Smiles . ] That younger generation that you are so afraid of ?
Solness . [ Nods slowly . ] And which , in my heart , I yearn towards so deeply .
[ Hilda rises , goes to the little table , and fetches Ragnar Brovik's portfolio .
Hilda .
[ Holds out the portfolio to him . ] We were talking of these drawings -- Solness .
[ Shortly , waving them away . ] Put those things away !
I have seen enough of them .
Hilda . Yes , but you have to write your approval on them . Solness .
Write my approval on them ?
Never ! Hilda .
But the poor old man is lying at death's door !
Can_ _n't you give him and his son this pleasure before they are parted ?
And perhaps he might get the commission to carry them out , too .
Solness . Yes , that is just what he would get .
He has made sure of that -- has my fine gentleman !
A lie ? [ Raging .
] Hilda -- take those devil's drawings out=of my sight !
Hilda . [ Draws the portfolio a=little nearer to herself .
] Well , well , well -- do_ _n't bite me .
-- You talk of trolls -- but I think you go on like a troll yourself . [ Looks round .
] Where do you keep your pen and ink ? Solness .
There is nothing of the sort in here .
Hilda . [ Goes towards the door .
] But in the office where that young lady is --
Solness . Stay where you are , Hilda !
-- I ought=to tell a lie , you say . Oh yes , for the sake of his old father I might well do that -- for in my time I have crushed him , trodden him under foot --
Hilda .
Him , too ?
Solness .
I needed room for myself .
But this Ragnar -- he must on no account be allowed to come to the front .
Hilda . Poor fellow , there is surely no fear of that .
If he has nothing in him --
Solness . [ Comes closer , looks at her , and whispers . ] If=Ragnar=Brovik gets his chance , he will strike me to the earth .
Crush me -- as I crushed his father .
Hilda . Crush you ?
Has he the ability for that ?
Solness . Yes , you may depend upon it he has the ability !
He is the younger generation that stands ready to knock at my door -- to make an end of Halvard Solness .
Hilda . [ Looks at him with quiet reproach .
] And yet you would bar him out .
Fie , Mr.=Solness !
Solness . The fight I have been fighting has cost heart's blood enough .
-- And I am afraid , too , that the helpers and servers will not obey me any longer . Hilda .
Then you must go ahead without them .
There is nothing=else for it .
Solness . It is hopeless , Hilda .
The luck is bound to turn .
A=little sooner or a little later .
Retribution is inexorable .
Hilda . [ In distress , putting her hands over her ears .
] Do_ _n't talk like that !
Do you want to kill me ? To take from me what=is=more than my life ?
Solness . And what is that ?
Hilda . The longing to see you great .
To see you , with a wreath in your hand , high , high up upon a church-tower . [ Calm again . ] Come , out with your pencil now .
You must have a pencil about you ?
Solness .
[ Takes out his pocket-book .
] I have one here . Hilda .
[ Lays the portfolio on the sofa-table . ] Very well .
Now let us two sit down here , Mr.=Solness . [ Solness seats himself at the table .
Hilda stands behind him , leaning over the back of the chair .
] And now we well write on the drawings .
We must write very , very nicely and cordially -- for this horrid Ruar -- or whatever his name is . Solness .
[ Writes a=few words , turns his head and looks at her .
Yes ! Solness .
If you have been waiting for me all these ten years -- Hilda .
What then ?
Solness . Why have you never written to me ?
Then I could have answered you . Hilda .
[ Hastily . ] No , no , no !
That was just what I did not want .
Solness . Why not ?
Hilda . I was afraid the whole thing might fall to pieces .
-- But we were going to write on the drawings , Mr.=Solness . Solness .
So we were . Hilda .
[ Bends forward and looks over his shoulder while he writes . ] Mind now , kindly and cordially !
Oh how I hate -- how I hate this Ruald -- Solness .
[ Writing . ] Have you never really cared for any one , Hilda ?
Hilda .
For any one else , I suppose you mean ?
Solness . [ Looks up at her .
] For any one else , yes .
Have you never ?
In all these ten years ?
Never ?
Hilda . Oh yes , now=and=then .
When I was perfectly furious with you for not coming . Solness .
Then you did take an interest in other people , too ?
Hilda .
A little bit -- for a week or=so .
Good=heavens , Mr.=Solness , you surely know how such things come about .
Solness . Hilda -- what is it you have come for ?
Hilda . Do_ _n't waste time talking .
The poor old man might go and die in the meantime .
Solness . Answer me , Hilda .
What do you want of me ?
Hilda . I want my kingdom .
Solness . H'm --
He gives a rapid glance toward the door on the left , and then goes on writing on the drawings .
At the same moment Mrs .
Solness enters .
Mrs . Solness .
Here are a=few things I have got for you , Miss=Wangel .
The large parcels will be sent later on .
Hilda . Oh , how very , very kind of you ! Mrs .
Solness . Only my simple duty .
Nothing more=than that . Solness . [ Reading over what he has written . ] Aline !
Mrs . Solness .
Yes ? Solness .
Did you notice whether the -- the book-keeper was out=there ? Mrs .
Solness . Yes , of=course , she was there .
Solness . [ Puts the drawings in the portfolio . ] H'm -- Mrs .
Solness . She was standing at the desk , as she always is -- when _I_ go through the room .
Solness . [ Rises .
] Then=I_ _ll give this to her and tell her that --
Hilda . [ Takes the portfolio from him .
] Oh , no , let me have the pleasure of doing that ! [ Goes to the door , but turns .
] What is her name ? Solness . Her name is Miss=Fosli .
Hilda . Pooh , that sounds so cold !
Her=Christian name , I mean ?
Solness . Kaia -- I believe .
Hilda . [ Opens the door and calls out .
] Kaia , come in here !
Make haste !
Mr. Solness wants to speak to you .
Kaia=fosli appears at the door .
KAIA . [ Looking at him in alarm . ] Here=I am -- ?
Hilda . [ Handing her the portfolio . ] See her , Kaia !
You can take this home ;
Mr. Solness was written on them now .
KAIA . Oh , at=last !
Solness . Give them to the old man as=soon=as you can . KAIA .
I will go straight home with them .
Solness . Yes , do .
Now Ragnar will have a chance of building for himself .
KAIA . Oh , may he come and thank you for all -- ?
Solness . [ Harshly . ] I will_ _n't have any thanks !
Tell him that from me . KAIA .
Yes , I will --
Solness . And tell him at the same time that henceforward I do not require his services -- nor yours either . KAIA . [ Softly and quiveringly .
] Not mine either ?
Solness .
You will have other things to think of now , and to attend to ;
and that is a very good thing for you .
Well , go home with the drawings now , Miss Fosli .
At=once !
Do you hear ? KAIA .
[ As before . ] Yes , Mr.=Solness . [ She goes out . Mrs . Solness .
Heavens !
what deceitful eyes she has .
Solness . She ?
That poor little creature ?
Mrs . Solness . Oh -- I can see what I can see , Halvard .
---- Are you really dismissing them ?
Solness . Yes .
Mrs . Solness . Her as=well ?
Solness . Was not that what you wished ? Mrs .
Solness . But how can you get on without her -- ?
Oh well , no doubt you have some one else in reserve , Halvard . Hilda . [ Playfully .
] Well , _I_ for one am not the person to stand at a desk . Solness .
Never mind , never mind -- it will be all=right , Aline .
Now all you have to do is think about moving into our new home -- as quickly as you can .
This evening we will hang up the wreath -- [ Turns to Hilda .
] What do you say to that , Miss=Hilda ?
Hilda . [ Looks at him with sparkling eyes . ] It will be splendid to see you so high up once=more .
Solness . Me !
Mrs . Solness . For Heaven's sake , Miss=Wangel , do_ _n't imagine such a thing !
My husband !
-- when he always gets so dizzy !
Hilda . He get dizzy !
No , I know quite well he does not ! Mrs .
Solness . Oh yes , indeed he does . Hilda .
But I have seen him with my own eyes right up at the top of a high church-tower ! Mrs .
Solness . Yes , I hear people talk of that ;
but it is utterly impossible --
Solness . [ Vehemently . ] Impossible -- impossible , yes !
But there I stood all the same ! Mrs .
Solness . O , how can you say so , Halvard ?
Why , you can_ _n't even bear to go out on the second-storey balcony here .
You have always been like that .
Solness . You may perhaps see something different this evening .
Mrs . Solness . [ In alarm . ] No , no , no !
Please=God=I shall never see that .
I will write at=once to the doctor -- and I am sure he will_ _n't let you do it .
Solness . Why , Aline -- !
Mrs . Solness .
Oh , you know you_ _re ill , Halvard .
This proves it !
Oh=God -- Oh God !
[ She goes hastily out to the right .
Hilda .
[ Looks intently at him . ] Is it so , or is it not ?
Solness . That I turn dizzy ?
Hilda . That my master builder dares not -- can_ _not -- climb as high as he builds ?
Solness . Is that the way you look at it ?
Hilda . Yes .
Solness . I believe there is scarcely a corner in me that is safe from you . Hilda .
[ Looks towards the bow-window . ] Up there , then .
Right up there --
Solness . [ Approaches her . ] You might have the topmost room in the tower , Hilda -- there you might live like a princess . Hilda .
[ Indefinably , between earnest and jest .
] Yes , that is what you promised me .
Solness . Did I really ?
Hilda . Fie , Mr.=Solness !
You said I should be a princess , and that you would give me a kingdom .
And then you went and -- Well ! Solness .
[ Cautiously .
] Do you mean that you did not do it ?
Solness . I scarcely know myself . [ More softly .
] But now I know so much for certain , that I -- Hilda .
That you -- ?
Say it at=once !
Solness . -- that I ought=to have done it .
Hilda . [ Exclaims with animation . ] Do_ _n't tell me you can ever be dizzy !
Solness . This evening , then , we will hang up the wreath -- Princess=Hilda . Hilda .
[ With a bitter curve of the lips . ] Over your new home , yes . Solness .
Over the new house , which will never be a home for me .
[ He goes out through the garden door .
Hilda . [ Looks straight in=front of her with a far-away expression , and whispers to herself .
The only words audible are : ] -- frightfully thrilling --
Act Third .
The large broad verandah of Solness's dwelling-house .
Part of the house , with outer door leading to the verandah , is seen to the left .
A railing along the verandah to the right .
At the back , from the end of the verandah , a flight of steps leads down to the garden below .
Tall old trees in the garden spread their branches over the verandah and towards the house .
Far to the right , in among the trees , a glimpse is caught of the lower part of the new villa , with scaffolding round so much as is seen of the tower .
In the background the garden is bounded by an old wooden fence .
Evening sky with sun-lit clouds .
On the verandah , a garden bench stands along the wall of the house , and in=front of the bench a long table .
On the other side of the table , an arm-chair and some stools .
All the furniture is of wicker-work .
Mrs .
Solness , wrapped in a large white crepe shawl , sits resting in the arm-chair and gazes over to the right .
Shortly after , Hilda=wangel comes up the flight of steps from the garden .
She is dressed as=in the last act , and wears her hat .
She has in her bodice a little nosegay of small common flowers .
Mrs .
Yes , I have been taking a look at it . Mrs .
Solness . And found some flowers too , I see . Hilda .
Yes , indeed !
There are such heaps of them in among the bushes . Mrs . Solness . Are there , really ?
Still ?
You see I scarcely ever go there .
Hilda . [ Closer .
] What ! Do_ _n't you take a run down into the garden every-day , then ?
Mrs . Solness .
[ With a faint smile .
] I do_ _n't « run » anywhere , nowadays .
Hilda .
Solness . It has all become so strange to me .
I am almost afraid to see it again .
Hilda . Your own garden ! Mrs .
Solness . I do_ _n't feel that it is mine any longer . Hilda .
What do you mean -- ?
Mrs . Solness .
No , no , it is not -- not as it was in my mother's and father's time .
They have taken away so much -- so much of the garden , Miss=Wangel .
Fancy -- they have parcelled it out -- and built houses for strangers -- people that I do_ _n't know .
And they can sit and look in upon me from their windows . Hilda .
[ With a bright expression . ] Mrs.=Solness !
Mrs . Solness .
Yes ? Hilda .
May I stay here with you a little ? Mrs .
Solness . Yes , by all means , if you care to .
[ Hilda moves a stool close to the arm-chair and sits down .
Hilda .
Ah -- here one can sit and sun oneself like a cat . Mrs .
Solness . [ Lays her hand softly on Hilda's neck . ] It is nice of you to be willing to sit with me .
I thought you wanted to go in to my husband . Hilda .
What should I want with him ?
Mrs . Solness . To help him , I thought . Hilda .
No , thank you .
And besides , he is not in .
He is over=there with his workmen .
But he looked so fierce that I did not dare to talk to him . Mrs .
Solness . He is so kind and gentle in reality .
Hilda . He !
Mrs . Solness . You do not really know him yet , Miss=Wangel . Hilda .
Solness . I ought=to be pleased ;
for it is what Halvard wants --
Hilda . Oh , not just on that account , surely ? Mrs .
Solness . Yes , yes , Miss=Wangel ;
for it is only my duty to submit myself to him .
But very often it is dreadfully difficult to force one's mind to obedience .
Hilda . Yes , that must be difficult indeed .
Mrs . Solness .
I can tell you it is -- when one has so many faults as I have -- Hilda .
When one has gone through so much trouble as you have -- Mrs .
Solness . How do you know about that ? Hilda .
Your husband told me .
Mrs . Solness . To me he very seldom mentions these things .
-- Yes , I can tell you I have gone through more=than enough trouble in my life , Miss=Wangel .
Hilda . [ Looks sympathetically at her and nods slowly . ] Poor=Mrs.=Solness . First of all there was the fire --
Mrs . Solness .
[ With a sigh . ] Yes , everything that was mine was burnt . Hilda .
And then came what was worse . Mrs .
Solness . [ Looking inquiringly at her . ] Worse ? Hilda . The=worst=of=all . Mrs .
Solness . What do you mean ?
Hilda . [ Softly . ] You lost the two little boys .
Mrs . Solness .
Oh , yes , the boys .
But , you see , that was a thing apart .
That was a dispensation of Providence ;
and in such things one can only bow in submission -- yes , and be thankful , too . Hilda .
Then you are so ?
Mrs . Solness .
Not always , I am sorry to say .
I know well enough that it is my duty -- but all=the=same I can_ _not .
Hilda .
No , no , I think that is only natural . Mrs .
Solness . And often and often I have to remind myself that it was a righteous punishment for me --
Hilda . Why ?
Mrs . Solness . Because I had not fortitude enough in misfortune .
Hilda . But I do_ _n't see that -- Mrs .
Solness . Oh , no , no , Miss=Wangel -- do not talk to me any=more about the two little boys .
We ought=to feel nothing but joy in thinking of them ;
for they are so happy -- so happy now .
No , it is the small losses in life that cut one to the heart -- the loss of all that other people look upon as almost nothing .
Hilda . [ Lays her arms on Mrs .
Solness's knees , and looks up at her affectionately .
] Dear=Mrs.=Solness -- tell me what things you mean !
Mrs . Solness .
As I say , only little things . All the old portraits were burnt on the walls .
And all the old silk dresses were burnt , what had belonged to the family for generations and generations .
And all mother's and grandmother's lace -- that was burnt , too .
And only think -- the jewels , too ! [ Sadly .
] And then all the dolls .
Hilda . The dolls ?
Mrs . Solness .
[ Choking with tears . ] I had nine lovely dolls . Hilda .
And they were burnt too ? Mrs .
Solness . All of them .
Oh , it was hard -- so hard for me .
Hilda . Had you put by all these dolls , then ?
Ever=since you were little ? Mrs . Solness .
I had not put them by .
The dolls and I had gone on living together .
Hilda . After you were grown up ? Mrs .
Solness . Yes , long after that .
Hilda . After you were married , too ? Mrs .
Solness . Oh yes , indeed .
So long as he did not see it -- . But they were all burnt up , poor things .
No one thought of saving them .
Oh , it is so miserable to think of .
You must_ _n't laugh at me , Miss=Wangel . Hilda .
I am not laughing in the least . Mrs .
Solness . For you see , in a certain sense , there was life in them , too .
I carried them under my heart -- like little unborn children . DR .
Herdal , with his hat in his hand , comes out through the door , and observes Mrs . Solness . and Hilda .
DR .
Herdal . Well , Mrs.=Solness , so you are sitting out here catching cold ? Mrs .
Solness . I find it so pleasant and warm here to-day . DR .
Herdal . Yes , yes .
But is there anything going on here ?
I got a note from you . Mrs .
Solness . [ Rises . ] Yes , there is something I must talk to you about .
DR . Herdal .
Very well ;
then perhaps we better go in . [ To Hilda . ] Still in your mountaineering dress , Miss=Wangel ?
Hilda . [ Gaily , rising .
] Yes -- in full uniform !
But to-day I am not going climbing and breaking my neck .
We two will stop quietly below and look on , doctor . DR .
Herdal . What are we to look on at ? Mrs .
Solness . [ Softly , in alarm , to Hilda . ] Hush , hush -- for God's sake !
He is coming !
Try to get that idea out=of his head . And let us be friends , Miss Wangel .
Do_ _n't you think we can ?
Hilda .
[ Throws her arms impetuously round Mrs . Solness's neck . ] Oh , if we only could ! Mrs .
Solness . [ Gently disengages herself . ] There , there , there !
There he comes , doctor .
Let me have a word with you . DR .
Herdal . Is it about him ? Mrs .
Solness . Yes , to be sure it_ _s about him .
Do come in .
She and the doctor enter the house .
Next moment Solness comes up from the garden by the flight of steps .
A serious look comes over Hilda's face . Solness .
[ Glances at the house-door , which is closed cautiously from within .
I have noticed that as=soon=as you come , you make her go .
Solness . Perhaps so .
But I can_ _not help it . [ Looks observantly at her .
] Are you cold , Hilda ?
I think you look cold .
Hilda . I have just come up out=of a tomb .
Solness . What do you mean by that ?
Hilda . That I have got chilled through and through , Mr.=Solness . Solness .
[ Slowly . ] I believe I understand -- Hilda .
What brings you up here just now ?
Solness . I caught sight of you from over=there .
Hilda . But then you must have seen her too ?
Solness . I knew she would go at=once if I came . Hilda .
Is it very painful for you that she should avoid you in this way ?
Solness . In one sense , it_ _s a relief as=well .
Hilda . Not to have her before your eyes ?
Solness . Yes .
Hilda . Not to be always seeing how heavily the loss of the little boys weighs upon her ?
Solness . Yes .
Chiefly that .
[ Hilda drifts across the verandah with her hands behind her back , stops at the railing and looks out over the garden .
Solness .
[ After a short pause . ] Did you have a long talk with her ?
[ Hilda stands motionless and does not answer .
Solness . Had you a long talk , I asked ? [ Hilda is silent as before .
Solness .
What was she talking about , Hilda ? [ Hilda continues silent .
Solness .
Poor Aline !
I suppose it was about the little boys .
Hilda .
[ A nervous shudder runs through her ;
then she nods hurriedly once=or=twice .
Solness . She will never get over it -- never in this world . [ Approaches her .
] Now you are standing there again like a statue ;
just as you stood last night . Hilda .
[ Turns and looks at him , with great serious eyes . ] I am going away .
Solness . [ Sharply . ] Going away !
Hilda . Yes .
Solness . But I will_ _n't allow you to !
Hilda . What am I to do here now ?
Solness . Simply to be here , Hilda ! Hilda .
[ Measures him with a look . ] Oh , thank you .
You know it would_ _n't end there . Solness . [ Heedlessly . ] So much the better !
Hilda . [ Vehemently .
] I can_ _not do any harm to one whom I know ! I can_ _n't take away anything that belongs to her .
Solness . Who wants you to do that ?
Hilda . [ Continuing .
] A stranger , yes !
for that is quite a different thing !
A person I have never set eyes on .
But one that I have come into close contact with -- !
Oh no !
Oh no !
Ugh !
Solness . Yes , but I never proposed you should .
Hilda . Oh , Mr.=Solness , you know quite well what the end of it would be .
And that is why I am going away .
Solness . And what is to become of me when you are gone ?
What shall I have to live for then ? -- After that ?
Hilda .
[ With the indefinable look in her eyes .
] It is surely not so hard for you .
You have your duties to her . Live for those duties .
Solness . Too late .
These powers -- these -- these --
Hilda . -- devils --
Solness . Yes , these devils !
And the troll within me as=well -- they have drawn all the life-blood out=of her . [ Laughs in desperation .
] They did it for my happiness !
Yes , yes ! [ Sadly .
] And now she is dead -- for my sake .
And I am chained alive to a dead woman . [ In wild anguish .
] _I_ -- _I_ who can_ _not live without joy in life !
[ Hilda moves round the table and seats herself on the bench , with her elbows on the table , and her head supported by her hands .
Hilda .
[ Sits and looks at him awhile . ] What will you build next ? Solness .
Not those cosy , happy homes for mother and father , and for the troop of children ?
Solness .
I wonder whether there will be any use for such homes in the coming time .
Hilda . Poor Mr.=Solness !
And you have gone all these ten years -- and staked your whole life -- on that alone . Solness .
Yes , you may well say so , Hilda . Hilda .
[ With an outburst . ] Oh , it all seems to me so foolish -- so foolish ! Solness .
All what ? Hilda .
Not to be able to grasp at your own happiness -- at your own life ! Merely because some one you know happens to stand in the way !
Solness .
One whom you have no right to set-aside .
Hilda . I wonder whether one really has not the right !
And yet , and yet -- .
Oh !
if one could only sleep the whole thing away !
[ She lays her arms flat don on the table , rests the left side of her head on her hands , and shuts her eyes .
Solness .
[ Without stirring , answers as=if half-asleep . ] I had only a cage . Solness .
And you are determined not to go back to it ? Hilda .
Rather range through the free air --
Hilda . [ Still as before . ] The bird of prey loves to range -- Solness .
[ In her usual voice ; opens her eyes but does not move .
] And the other thing ?
Say what that was ! Solness .
A robust conscience . [ Hilda sits erect on the bench , with animation .
Her eyes have once=more the sparkling expression of gladness .
Hilda .
Then you know more=than I do , Hilda .
Hilda . Yes , builders are such stupid people . Solness .
What is it to be then ? Hilda .
[ Nods again . ] The castle . Solness .
What castle ? Hilda .
My castle , of=course .
Solness . Do you want a castle now ?
Hilda . Do_ _n't you owe me a kingdom , I should like to know ?
Solness . You say I do .
Hilda .
Well -- you admit you owe me this kingdom .
And you can_ _n't have a kingdom without a royal castle , I should think . Solness .
[ More=and=more animated . ] Yes , they usually go together .
Hilda . Good !
Then build it for me !
This moment !
Solness . [ Laughing .
] Must you have that on the instant , too ? Hilda . Yes , to be sure !
For the ten years are up now , and I am not going to wait any longer .
So -- out with the castle , Mr.=Solness !
Solness . It_ _s no light matter to owe you anything , Hilda . Hilda .
You should have thought of that before .
It is too late now .
So -- [ tapping the table ] -- the castle on the table !
It is my castle !
I will have it at once !
Solness . [ More seriously , leans over towards her , with his arms on the table .
] What sort of castle have you imagined , Hilda ?
[ Her expression becomes more=and=more veiled . She seems gazing inwards at herself .
Hilda . [ Slowly .
] My castle shall stand on a height -- on a very great height -- with a clear outlook on=all=sides , so=that I can see far -- far around . Solness .
And no doubt it is to have a high tower !
Hilda .
A tremendously high tower .
And at the very top of the tower there shall be a balcony .
And I will stand out upon it --
Solness . [ Involuntarily clutches at his forehead .
] How can you like to stand at such a dizzy height -- ? Hilda . Yes , I will !
Right up there will I stand and look down on the other people -- on those that are building churches , and homes for mother and father and the troop of children .
And you may come up and look on at it , too . Solness .
[ In a low tone . ] Is the builder to be allowed to come up beside the princess ? Hilda .
If the builder will . Solness .
[ More softly . ] Then=I think the builder will come . Hilda .
[ Nods . ] The builder -- he will come . Solness .
But he will never be able to build any=more . Poor builder ! Hilda . [ Animated .
] Oh , yes , he will !
We two will set to work together .
And then we will build the loveliest -- the very loveliest -- thing in all the world . Solness .
[ Intently . ] Hilda -- tell me what that is ! Hilda .
[ Looks smilingly at him , shakes her head a little , pouts , and speaks as if to a child . ] Builders -- they are such very -- very stupid people .
Solness . Yes , no doubt they are stupid .
But now tell me what it is -- the loveliest thing in the world -- that we two are to build together ? Hilda .
[ Is silent a little while , then says with an indefinable expression in her eyes .
] Castles in the air .
Solness . Castles in the air ?
Hilda . [ Nods .
] Castles in the air , yes !
Do you know what sort of thing a castle in the air is ?
Solness . It is the loveliest thing in the world , you say .
Hilda . [ Rises with vehemence , and makes a gesture of repulsion with her hand .
] Yes , to be sure it is !
[ Rises . ] After this day we two will build together , Hilda . Hilda .
[ With a half-dubious smile . ] A real castle in the air ?
Solness . Yes .
One with a firm foundation under it .
Ragnar=brovik comes out from the house .
He is carrying a large green wreath with flowers and silk ribbons .
Hilda .
[ With an outburst of pleasure . ] The wreath !
Oh , that will be glorious !
Solness . [ In surprise .
] Have you brought the wreath Ragnar ?
Ragnar . I promised the foreman I would . Solness . [ Relieved . ] Ah , then I suppose you father is better ?
Ragnar . No.
Solness . Was he not cheered by what I wrote ?
Ragnar . It came too late .
Solness . Too late !
Ragnar . When she came with it he was unconscious .
He had had a stroke . Solness .
Why , then , you must go home to him !
You must attend to your father !
Ragnar . He does not need me any=more .
Solness . But surely you ought=to be with him .
Ragnar . She is sitting by his bed .
Solness . [ Rather uncertainly .
] Kaia ? Ragnar . [ Looking darkly at him .
] Yes -- Kaia . Solness .
Go home , Ragnar -- both to him and to her .
Give me the wreath .
Ragnar . [ Suppresses a mocking smile .
] You do_ _n't mean that you yourself -- ?
Solness . I will take it down to them myself [ Takes the wreath from him . ] And now you go home ;
we do_ _n't require you to-day .
Ragnar . I know you do not require me any=more ;
but to-day I shall remain .
Solness . Well , remain then , since you are bent upon it .
Hilda . [ At the railing . ] Mr.=Solness , I will stand here and look on at you . Solness .
At me ! Hilda .
It will be fearfully thrilling .
Solness . [ In a low tone . ] We will talk about that presently , Hilda .
Hilda .
[ Looks after him , then turns to Ragnar .
] I think you might at=least have thanked him
Ragnar .
Thanked him ?
Ought I to have thanked him ? Hilda . Yes , of=course you ought !
Ragnar . I think it is rather you I ought=to thank . Hilda .
How can you say such a thing ?
Ragnar . [ Without answering her . ] But=I advise you to take care , Miss=Wangel !
For you do_ _n't know him rightly yet .
Hilda . [ Ardently . ] Oh , no=one knows him as I do !
Ragnar . [ Laughs in exasperation .
] Thank him , when he has held me down year after year !
When he made father disbelieve in me -- made me disbelieve in myself !
And all merely that he might -- !
Hilda . [ As=if divining something . ] That he might -- ?
Tell me at=once !
Ragnar . That he might keep her with him . Hilda .
[ With a start towards him . ] The girl at the desk .
Ragnar . Yes .
Hilda . [ Threateningly , clenching her hands . ] That is not true !
You are telling falsehoods about him !
Ragnar . I would not believe it either until to-day -- when she said so herself . Hilda .
[ As=if beside herself . ] What did she say ?
I will know !
At=once ! at=once !
Ragnar .
She said that he had taken possession of her mind -- her whole mind -- centred all her thoughts upon himself alone . She says that she can never leave him -- that she will remain here , where he is --
Hilda . [ With flashing eyes .
] She will not be allowed to !
Ragnar . [ As=if feeling his way .
] Who will not allow her ?
Hilda . [ Rapidly .
] He will not either ! Ragnar .
Oh no -- I understand the whole thing now .
After this , she would merely be -- in the way .
Hilda . You understand nothing -- since you can talk like that !
No , _I_ will tell you why he kept hold of her .
Ragnar .
Well then , why ? Hilda .
In=order=to keep hold of you . Ragnar . Has he told you so ?
Hilda . No , but it is so .
It must be so ! [ Wildly .
] I will -- I will have it so ! Ragnar .
And at the very moment when you came -- he let her go . Hilda .
It was you -- you that he let go !
What do you suppose he cares about strange women like her ?
Ragnar . [ Reflects .
] Is it possible that all this time he has been afraid of me ? Hilda . He afraid !
I would not be so conceited if I were you .
Ragnar . Oh , he must have seen long=ago that I had something in me , too .
Besides -- cowardly -- that is just what he is , you see .
Hilda . He !
Oh yes , I am likely to believe that !
Ragnar .
In a certain sense he is cowardly -- he , the great master builder .
He is not afraid of robbing others of their happiness -- as he has done both for my father and me .
But when it comes to climbing up a paltry bit of scaffolding -- he will do anything rather=than that .
Hilda . Oh , you should just have seen him high , high up -- at the dizzy height where I once saw him .
Ragnar .
Did you see that ? Hilda .
Yes , indeed I did . How free and great he looked as he stood and fastened the wreath to the church vane ! Ragnar .
I know that he ventured that , once in his life -- one solitary time .
It is a legend among us younger men .
But no power on earth would induce him to do it again .
Hilda . To-day he will do it again !
Ragnar . [ Scornfully . ] Yes , I daresay ! Hilda .
We shall see it !
Ragnar .
That neither you nor I will see . Hilda .
[ With uncontrollable vehemence . ] I will se it ! I will and I must see it ! Ragnar .
But he will not do it .
He simply dare not do it .
For you see he can_ _not get over this infirmity -- master builder though he be .
Mrs . Solness comes from the house on to the verandah .
Mrs .
Solness . [ Looks around . ] Is he not here ?
Where has he gone to ?
Ragnar . Mr.=Solness is down with the men . Hilda .
He took the wreath with him . Mrs .
Solness . [ Terrified . ] Took the wreath with him !
Oh=God ! oh God !
Brovik -- you must go down to him !
Get him to come back here !
Ragnar . Shall I say you want to speak to him , Mrs.=Solness ? Mrs .
Solness . Oh yes , do !
-- No , no -- do_ _n't say that _I_ want anything !
You can say that somebody is here , and that he must come at=once .
Ragnar . Good .
I will do so , Mrs.=Solness .
[ He goes down the flight of steps and away through the garden .
Mrs .
Is there anything in this to be terribly frightened about ? Mrs .
Solness . Oh yes ; surely you can understand .
Just think , if he were really to do it !
If he should take it into his head to climb up the scaffolding ! Hilda .
[ Eagerly . ] Do you think he will ? Mrs .
Solness . Oh , one can never tell what he might take into his head .
I am afraid there is nothing he might_ _n't think of doing . Hilda . Aha !
Perhaps you too think he is -- well -- ? Mrs .
Solness . Oh , I do_ _n't know what to think about him now .
The doctor has been telling me all sorts of things ;
and putting it all together with several things I have heard him say --
DR . Herdal looks out , at the door . DR .
Herdal . Is he not coming soon ? Mrs .
Solness . Yes , I think so .
I have sent for him at=any=rate . DR .
Herdal . [ Advancing . ] I am afraid you will have to go in , my dear lady -- Mrs .
Solness . Oh no ! Oh no !
I shall stay out here and wait for Halvard . DR .
Herdal . But some ladies have just come to call on you -- Mrs .
Solness . Good=heavens , that too !
And just at this moment !
DR . Herdal . They say they positively must see the ceremony . Mrs . Solness .
Well , well , I suppose I must go to them after all .
It is my duty . Hilda .
Can_ _n't you ask the ladies to go away ? Mrs .
Solness . No , that would never do .
Now that they are here , it is my duty to see them .
But do you stay out here in the meantime -- and receive him when he comes . DR .
Herdal . And try to occupy his attention as=long=as possible -- Mrs .
Solness . Yes , do , dear Miss=Wangel .
Keep as firm hold of him as ever you can .
Hilda . Would it not be best for you to do that ? Mrs .
Solness . Yes ; God knows that is my duty .
But when one has duties in so many directions -- DR .
Herdal . [ Looks towards the garden . ] There he is coming . Mrs .
Solness . And I have to go in !
DR . Herdal . [ To Hilda . ] Do_ _n't say anything about my being here . Hilda . Oh no !
I daresay I shall find something=else to talk to Mr.=Solness about . Mrs .
Solness . And be sure you keep firm hold of him .
I believe you can do it best . [ Mrs .
Solness and DR . Herdal go into the house .
Hilda remains standing on the verandah .
Solness comes from the garden , up the flight of steps . Solness .
Somebody wants me , I hear . Hilda .
Yes ; it is I , Mr.=Solness .
Solness . Oh , is it you , Hilda ?
I was afraid it might be Aline or the Doctor . Hilda .
You are very easily frightened , it seems !
Solness . Do you think so ?
Hilda . Yes ; people say that you are afraid to climb about -- on the scaffoldings , you know .
Solness . Well , that is quite a special thing . Hilda .
Then it is true that you are afraid to do it ?
Solness . Yes , I am .
Hilda . Afraid of falling down and killing yourself ?
Solness . No , not of that .
Hilda . Of what , then ?
Solness . I am afraid of retribution , Hilda . Hilda .
Of retribution ? [ Shakes her head .
] I do_ _n't understand that .
Solness .
Sit down , and I will tell you something .
Hilda . Yes , do !
At=once !
[ She sits on a stool by the railing , and looks expectantly at him .
Solness .
] I know that well . Solness .
For , you see , I came as a boy from a pious home in the country ;
and so it seemed to me that this church-building was the noblest task I could set myself .
Hilda . Yes , yes .
That -- ?
Well ?
Solness . Well , that I think that he ought=to have been pleased with me .
Hilda . He ?
What he ?
Solness . He who was to have the churches , of=course !
He to whose honour and glory they were dedicated .
Hilda . Oh , indeed !
[ Scornfully . ] He pleased with me !
How can you talk so , Hilda ?
He who gave the troll in me leave to lord it just as it pleased .
He who bade them be at hand to serve me , both day and might -- all these -- all these --
Hilda . Devils --
Solness . Yes , of both kinds .
Oh no , he made me feel clearly enough that he was not pleased with me . [ Mysteriously .
] You see , that was really the reason why he made the old house burn down . Hilda .
Was that why ?
Solness . Yes , do_ _n't you understand ?
He wanted to give me the chance of becoming an accomplished master in my own sphere -- so=that I might build all the more glorious churches for him .
At=first I did not understand what he was driving at ;
but all=of=a=sudden it flashed upon me .
Hilda . When was that ?
Solness . It was when I was building the church-tower up at Lysanger . Hilda .
I thought so . Solness .
For you see , Hilda -- up there , amidst those new surroundings , I used to go about musing and pondering within myself .
Then I saw plainly why he had taken my little children from me .
It was that I should have nothing else to attach myself to .
No=such thing as love and happiness , you understand .
] But=I can tell you nothing came of that !
Hilda .
What did you do then ?
Solness . First=of=all , I searched and tried my own heart --
Hilda . And then ?
Solness . The I did the impossible -- I , no less=than he .
Hilda .
The impossible ?
Solness . I had never before been able to climb up=to a great , free height .
But that day I did it . Hilda .
[ Leaping up . ] Yes , yes , you did ! Solness .
And when I stood there , high over everything , and was hanging the wreath over the vane , I said to him : Hear me now , thou Mighty=One !
From this day forward I will be a free builder -- I too , in my sphere -- just as thou in thine .
I will never more build churches for thee -- only homes for human beings . Hilda .
[ With great sparkling eyes .
But afterwards his turn came .
Hilda . What do you mean by that ?
Do you say that now ?
Solness . Yes , for now I see it .
Men have no use for these homes of theirs -- to be happy in .
And I should not have had any use for such a home , if I had had one . [ With a quiet , bitter laugh .
] See , that is the upshot of the whole affair , however far=back I look .
Nothing really built ;
nor anything sacrificed for the chance of building .
Nothing , nothing !
the whole is nothing ! Hilda .
Then you will never build anything more ?
Solness . [ With animation .
] On=the=contrary , I am just going to begin ! Hilda .
What , then ?
What will you build ?
Tell me at=once !
Solness . I believe there is only one possible dwelling-place for human happiness -- and that is what I am going to build now .
Hilda . [ Looks fixedly at him . ] Mr.=Solness -- you mean our castles in the air . Solness .
The castles in the air -- yes .
Hilda . I am afraid you would turn dizzy before we got half-way up . Solness .
Not if I can mount hand=in=hand with you , Hilda . Hilda .
[ With an expression of suppressed resentment . ] Only with me ?
Will there be no others of the party ?
Solness . Who=else should there be ? Hilda .
Oh -- that girl -- that Kaia at the desk .
Poor thing -- do_ _n't you want to take her with you too ?
Solness . Oho !
Was it about her that Aline was talking to you ?
Hilda . Is it so -- or is it not ?
Solness . [ Vehemently . ] I will not answer such a question .
You must believe in me , wholly and entirely !
Hilda . All these ten years I have believed in you so utterly -- so utterly . Solness .
You must go on believing in me !
Hilda . Then let me see you stand free and high up ! Solness .
[ Sadly . ] Oh=Hilda -- it is not every day that I can do that .
Hilda . [ Passionately .
] I will have you do it !
I will have it ! [ Imploringly . ] Just once=more , Mr.=Solness !
Do the impossible once=again !
[ In rising excitement . ] What will you say to him ? Solness .
I will say to him : Hear me , Mighty=Lord -- thou may'st judge me as seems best to thee .
But hereafter I will build nothing but the loveliest thing in the world -- Hilda .
[ Carried away . ] Yes -- yes -- yes !
Solness . -- build it together with a princess , whom I love --
Hilda . Yes , tell him that !
Tell him that !
Solness . Yes .
-- many times ! Say that !
Solness .
-- many , many times , I will say it ! Hilda .
And then -- ?
How have you made me what I am ? Solness .
[ Shortly and firmly . ] The princess shall have her castle . Hilda .
[ Jubilant , clapping her hands . ] Oh , Mr.=Solness -- !
My lovely , lovely castle . Our castle in the air !
Solness .
On a firm foundation .
[ In the street a crowd of people has assembled , vaguely seen through the trees .
Music of wind-instruments is heard far away behind the new house .
Mrs . Solness , with a fur collar round her neck , Doctor Herdal with her white shawl on his arm , and some ladies , come out on the verandah .
Ragnar=brovik comes at the same time up from the garden .
Mrs .
Solness . [ To Ragnar . ] Are we to have music , too ?
Ragnar . Yes .
It_ _s the band of the Mason's Union . [ To Solness .
] The foreman asked me to tell you that he is ready now to go up with the wreath .
Solness . [ Takes his hat . ] Good .
I will go down to him myself . Mrs . Solness . [ Anxiously .
] What have you to do down there , Halvard ? Solness .
[ Curtly . ] I must be down below with the men . Mrs . Solness .
Yes , down below -- only down below .
Solness .
That is where I always stand -- on everyday occasions .
[ He goes down the flight of steps and away through the garden .
Mrs .
Solness . [ Calls after him over the railing . ] But do beg the man to be careful when he goes up !
Promise me that , Halvard ! DR .
Herdal . [ To Mrs . Solness .
] Do_ _n't you see that I was right ?
He has given up all thought of that folly .
Mrs . Solness .
Oh , what a relief !
Herdal . [ Playfully .
Solness and DR . Herdal go up=to the ladies , who are standing nearer to the steps and looking over the garden .
Hilda remains standing beside the railing in the foreground .
Ragnar goes up=to her .
Ragnar .
Yes . Ragnar .
They are my fellow students , come to look at the master . Hilda .
What do they want to look at him for ?
Ragnar . They want to see how he dare_ _n't climb to the top of his own house . Hilda .
Oh , that is what those boys want , is it ?
Ragnar . [ Spitefully and scornfully .
] He has kept us down so long -- now we are going to see him keep quietly down below himself .
Hilda .
You will not see that -- not this time .
Ragnar . [ Smiles .
] Indeed ! Then where shall we see him ?
Hilda . High -- high up by the vane ! That is where you will see him !
Ragnar .
[ Laughs .
] Him ! Oh yes , I daresay !
Hilda . His will is to reach the top -- so at the top you shall see him .
Ragnar . His will , yes ;
that I can easily believe .
But he simply can_ _not do it .
His head would swim round , long , long=before he got half-way .
He would have to crawl down again on his hands and knees .
DR . Herdal . [ Points across .
] Look ! There goes the foreman up the ladders . Mrs .
Solness . And of=course he has the wreath to carry too .
Oh , I do hope he will be careful !
Ragnar . [ Stares incredulously and shouts . ] Why , but it_ _s -- Hilda .
[ Breaking out in jubilation . ] It is the master builder himself ? Mrs . Solness .
[ Screams with terror . ] Yes , it is Halvard !
Oh my great God -- !
Halvard !
Halvard !
DR . Herdal . Hush !
Do_ _n't shout to him !
Mrs . Solness . [ Half beside herself .
] I must go to him !
I must get him to come down again ! DR . Herdal . [ Holds her .
] Do_ _n't move , any of you !
Not a sound ! Hilda . [ Immovable , follows Solness with her eyes . ] He climbs and climbs .
Higher and higher !
Higher and higher !
Look !
Just look !
Ragnar . [ Breathless .
] He must turn now .
He can_ _n't possibly help it . Hilda . He climbs and climbs .
He will soon be at the top now .
Mrs . Solness . Oh , I shall die of terror .
I can_ _not bear to see it . DR .
Herdal . Then do_ _n't look up at him .
Hilda . There he is standing on the topmost planks !
Right at the top !
DR . Herdal . Nobody must move !
Do you dear ?
Hilda . [ Exulting , with quiet intensity .
] At=last ! At=last !
Now I see him great and free again !
Ragnar . [ Almost voiceless . ] But this is im -- Hilda .
So I have seen him all through these ten years .
How secure he stands !
Frightfully thrilling all=the=same .
Look at him !
Now he is hanging the wreath round the vane ! Ragnar .
I feel as=if I were looking at something utterly impossible .
Hilda . Yes , it is the impossible that he is doing now ! [ With the indefinable expression in her eyes .
] Can you see any one else up there with him ?
Ragnar . There is no=one else .
Hilda . Yes , there is one he is striving with .
Ragnar . You are mistaken .
Hilda . Then do you hear no song in the air , either ?
Ragnar . It must be the wind in the tree-tops .
Hilda . _I_ hear a song -- a mighty song ! [ Shouts in wild jubilation and glee .
] Look , look !
Now he is waving his hat !
He is waving it to us down here !
Oh , wave , wave back to him !
For now it is finished ! [ Snatches the white shawl from the Doctor , waves it , and shouts up=to Solness .
Herdal . Stop !
Stop !
For=God's sake -- !
[ The ladies on the verandah wave their pocket-handkerchiefs , and the shouts of « Hurrah » are taken up in the street .
Then they are suddenly silenced , and the crowd bursts out into a shriek of horror .
A human body , with planks and fragments of wood , is vaguely perceived crashing down behind the trees .
Mrs .
Solness And The Ladies . [ At the same time . ] He is falling ! He is falling ! [ Mrs .
The crowd in the street breaks down the fence and storms into the garden .
At the same time DR . Herdal , too , rushes down thither .
A short pause .
Hilda . [ Stares fixedly upwards and says , as=if petrified . ] My=Master=Builder .
Ragnar . [ Supports himself , trembling , against the railing .
] He must be dashed to pieces -- killed on the spot . One Of The Ladies .
[ Whilst Mrs . Solness is carried into the house . ] Run down for the doctor --
Ragnar . I can_ _n't stir a root --
Another Lady . Then call to some one !
Ragnar . [ Tries to call out . ] How is it ?
Is he alive ?
A Voice . [ Below , in the garden . ] Mr.=Solness is dead !
Other Voices . [ Nearer . ] The head is all crushed .
-- he fell right into the quarry .
Hilda . [ Turns to Ragnar , and says quietly . ] I can_ _n't see him up there now .
Ragnar . This is terrible .
So , after all , he could not do it .
Hilda . [ As=if in quiet spell-bound triumph .
] But he mounted right to the top .
And I heard harps in the air . [ Waves her shawl in the air , and shrieks with wild intensity .
