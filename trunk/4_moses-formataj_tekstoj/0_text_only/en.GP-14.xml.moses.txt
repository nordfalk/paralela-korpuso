Act First
[ A pretty and richly-decorated garden-room , full of furniture , flowers , and plants .
At the back , open glass doors , leading out to a verandah .
An extensive view over the fiord .
In the distance , wooded hillsides .
A door in each of the side walls , the one on the right a folding door , placed far=back .
In=front on the right , a sofa , with cushions and rugs .
Beside the sofa , a small table , and chairs .
In=front , on the left , a larger table , with arm-chairs around it .
On the table stands an open hand-bag .
It is an early summer morning , with warm sunshine .
]
[ Mrs . Rita=allmers stands beside the table , facing towards the left , engaged in unpacking the bag .
She is a handsome , rather tall , well-developed blonde , about thirty years of age , dressed in a light-coloured morning-gown .
]
[ Shortly after , Miss=ASTA=ALLMERS enters by the door on the right , wearing a light brown summer dress , with hat , jacket , and parasol .
Under her arm she carries a locked portfolio of considerable size .
She is slim , of middle height , with dark hair , and deep , earnest eyes .
Twenty-five years old .
]
ASTA . [ As she enters .
] Good-morning , my dear Rita . Rita . [ Turns her head , and nods to her .
] What !
is that you , Asta ?
Come all the way from town so early ?
ASTA . [ Takes of her things , and lays them on a chair beside the door .
] Yes , such a restless feeling came over me .
I felt I must come out to-day , and see how little Eyolf was getting on -- and you too . [ Lays the portfolio on the table beside the sofa .
] So=I took the steamer , and here I am . Rita . [ Smiling to her .
] And=I daresay you met one or other of your friends on-board ?
Quite by chance , of=course .
ASTA . [ Quietly .
] No , I did not meet a soul I knew . [ Sees the bag .
] Why , Rita , what have you got there ?
Rita . [ Still unpacking .
] Alfred's travelling-bag .
Do_ _n't you recognise it ?
ASTA . [ Joyfully , approaching her . ] What !
Has=Alfred come home ?
Rita .
Yes , only think -- he came quite unexpectedly by the late train last night .
ASTA .
Oh , then that was what my feeling meant !
It was that that drew me out here !
And he had_ _n't written a line to let you know ?
Not even a post-card ?
Rita .
Not a single-word .
ASTA .
Did he not even telegraph ?
Rita .
Yes , an hour before he arrived -- quite curtly and coldly . [ Laughs .
] Do_ _n't you think that was like him , Asta ? ASTA .
Yes ;
he goes so quietly about everything .
Rita .
But that made it all=the=more delightful to have him again .
ASTA .
Yes , I am sure it would .
Rita .
A whole fortnight before I expected him !
ASTA .
And is he quite well ?
Not in low spirits ?
Rita . [ Closes the bag with a snap , and smiles at her . ] He looked quite transfigured as he stood in the doorway .
ASTA .
And was he not the least bit tired either ?
Rita .
Oh , yes , he seemed to be tired enough -- very tired , in=fact .
But , poor fellow , he had come on foot the greater part of the way .
ASTA .
And then perhaps the high mountain air may have been rather too keen for him .
Rita .
Oh , no ; I do_ _n't think so at=all .
I have_ _n't heard him cough once .
ASTA .
Ah , there you see now !
It was a good thing , after all , that the doctor talked him into taking this tour .
Rita .
Yes , now that it is safely over .
-- But I can tell you it has been a terrible time for me , Asta .
I have never cared to talk about it -- and you so seldom came out to see me , too --
ASTA .
Yes , I daresay that was_ _n't very nice of me -- but --
Rita .
Well , well , well , of=course you had your school to attend to in town . [ Smiling .
] And then our road-maker friend -- of=course he was away too .
ASTA .
Oh , do_ _n't talk like that , Rita .
Rita .
Very well , then ;
we will leave the road-maker out=of the question .
-- You can_ _n't think how I have been longing for Alfred !
How empty the place seemed !
How desolate !
Ugh , it felt as=if there had been a funeral in the house !
ASTA .
Why , dear me , only six or seven weeks --
Rita .
Yes ; but you must remember that Alfred has never been away from me before -- never so much as twenty-four hours .
Not once in all these ten years .
ASTA .
No ; but that is just why I really think it was high time he should have a little outing this year .
He ought=to have gone for a tramp in the mountains every summer -- he really ought .
Rita . [ Half smiling .
] Oh yes , it_ _s all very well fair you to talk .
If I were as -- as reasonable its you , I suppose I should have let him go before -- perhaps .
But I positively could not , Asta !
It seemed to me I should never get him back again .
Surely you can understand that ?
ASTA .
No. But=I daresay that is because I have no=one to lose .
Rita . [ With a teasing smile .
] Really ? No=one at=all ?
ASTA .
Not that _I_ know of . [ Changing the subject .
] But tell me , Rita , where is Alfred ?
Is he still asleep ?
Rita .
Oh , not at=all .
He got up as=early=as ever to-day .
ASTA .
Then he can_ _n't have been so very tired after all .
Rita .
Yes , he was last night -- when he arrived .
But now he has had little Eyolf with him in his room for a whole hour and more .
ASTA .
Poor little white-faced boy !
Has he to be for=ever at his lessons again ?
Rita . [ With a slight shrug .
] Alfred will have it so , you know . ASTA .
Yes ;
but I think you ought=to put down your foot about it , Rita .
Rita . [ Somewhat impatiently .
] Oh no ; come now , I really can_ _not meddle with that .
Alfred knows so much better about these things than I do .
And what would you have Eyolf do ?
He can_ _n't run about and play , you see -- like other children .
ASTA . [ With decision .
] I will talk to Alfred about this .
Rita .
Yes , do ;
I wish you would .
-- Oh ! here he is . [ Alfred Allmers , dressed in light summer clothes , enters by the door on the left , leading Eyolf by the hand .
He is a slim , lightly-built man of about thirty-six or thirty-seven , with gentle eyes , and thin brown hair and beard .
His expression is serious and thoughtful .
Eyolf wears a suit cut like a uniform , with gold braid and gilt military buttons .
He is lame , and walks with a crutch under his left arm. His leg is shrunken .
He is undersized , and looks delicate , but has beautiful intelligent eyes .
]
] Asta !
My dearest Asta !
To think of your coming !
To think of my seeing you so soon !
ASTA .
I felt I must -- .
Welcome home again !
Allmers . [ Shaking her hands .
] Thank you for coming .
Rita .
Does_ _n't he look well ?
ASTA . [ Gazes fixedly at him .
] Splendid !
Quite splendid ! His eyes are so much brighter !
And I suppose you have done a great deal of writing on your travels ? [ With an outburst of joy .
] I should_ _n't wonder if you had finished the whole book , Alfred ?
Allmers . [ Shrugging his shoulders .
] The book ?
Oh , the book --
ASTA .
Yes , I was sure you would find it go so easily when once you got away .
Allmers .
So I thought too .
But , do you know , I did_ _n't find it so at=all .
The truth is , I have not written a line of the book .
ASTA .
Not a line ?
Rita .
Oho !
I wondered when I found all the paper lying untouched in your bag .
ASTA .
But , my dear Alfred , what have you been doing all this time ?
Allmers . [ Smiling .
] Only thinking and thinking and thinking .
] And thinking a little , too , of those you had left at-home ?
Allmers .
Yes , you may be sure of that .
I have thought a great deal of you -- every single day .
Rita . [ Taking her arm away .
] Ah , that is all I care about .
ASTA .
But you have_ _n't even touched the book !
And yet you can look so happy and contented !
That is not what you generally do -- I mean when your work is going badly .
Allmers .
You are right there .
You see , I have been such a fool hitherto .
All the best that is in you goes into thinking .
What you put on paper is worth very little .
ASTA . [ Exclaiming .
] Worth very little !
Rita . [ Laughing .
] What an absurd thing to say , Alfred .
] Oh yes , Papa , what you write is worth a great deal !
] Well , well , since you say so .
-- But I can tell you , some one is coming after me who will do it better .
Eyolf .
Who can that be ?
Oh , tell me !
Allmers .
Only wait -- you may be sure he will come , and let us hear of him .
Eyolf .
And what will you do then ?
Allmers . [ Seriously .
] Then=I will go to the mountains again --
Rita .
Fie , Alfred ! For shame !
Allmers .
-- up=to the peaks and the great waste places .
Eyolf .
Papa , do_ _n't you think I shall soon be well enough for you to take me with you ?
Allmers . [ With painful emotion .
] Oh , yes , perhaps , my little boy .
Eyolf .
It would be so splendid , you know , if I could climb the mountains , like you .
ASTA . [ Changing the subject .
] Why , how beautifully you are dressed to-day , Eyolf !
Eyolf .
Yes , do_ _n't you think so , Auntie ?
ASTA .
Yes , indeed . Is it in honour of Papa that you have got your new clothes on ?
Eyolf .
Yes , I asked Mama to let me .
I wanted so to let Papa see me in them .
] You should_ _n't have given him clothes like that .
Rita . [ In a low voice .
] Oh , he has teased me so long about them -- he had set his heart on them .
He gave me no peace .
Eyolf .
And I forgot to tell you , Papa -- Borgheim has bought me a new bow .
And he has taught me how to shoot with it too .
Allmers .
Ah , there now -- that_ _s just the sort of thing for you , Eyolf .
Eyolf .
And next time he comes , I shall ask him to teach me to swim , too .
Allmers .
To swim !
Oh , what makes you want to learn swimming ?
Eyolf .
Well , you know , all the boys down at the beach can swim .
I am the only one that can_ _n't .
] You shall learn whatever you like -- everything you really want to .
Eyolf .
Then do you know what I want most=of=all , Papa ?
Allmers .
No ;
tell me .
Eyolf .
I want most=of=all to be a soldier .
Allmers .
Oh , little Eyolf , there are many , many=other things that are better than that .
Eyolf .
Ah , but when I grow big , then I shall have to be a soldier .
You know that , do_ _n't you ?
Allmers . [ Clenching his hands together .
] Well , well , well : we shall see --
ASTA . [ Seating herself at the table on the left . ] Eyolf !
Come here to me , and I will tell you something .
Eyolf . [ Goes up=to her .
] What is it , Auntie ?
ASTA .
What do you think , Eyolf -- I have seen the Rat-Wife .
Eyolf .
What !
Seen the Rat-Wife !
Oh , you_ _re only making a fool of me !
ASTA .
No ; it_ _s quite true .
I saw her yesterday .
Eyolf .
Where did you see her ?
ASTA .
I saw her on the road , outside the town .
Allmers .
I saw her , too , somewhere up in the country .
] Perhaps it will be out turn to see her next , Eyolf .
Eyolf .
Auntie , is_ _n't it strange that she should be called the Rat-Wife ?
ASTA .
Oh , people just give her that name because she wanders round the country driving away all the rats .
Allmers .
I have heard that her real name is Varg .
Eyolf .
Varg !
That means a wolf , does_ _n't it ?
] So you know that , do you ?
Eyolf . [ Cautiously .
] Then perhaps it may be true , after all , that she is a were-wolf at night .
Do you believe that , Papa ?
Allmers .
Oh , no ; I do_ _n't believe it .
Now you ought=to go and play a little in the garden .
Eyolf .
Should I not take some books with me ?
Allmers .
No , no books after this .
You had better go down to the beach to the other boys .
Eyolf . [ Shyly .
] No , Papa , I will_ _n't go down to the boys to-day .
Allmers .
Why not ?
Eyolf .
Oh , because I have these clothes on .
Allmers . [ Knitting his brows .
] Do you mean that they make fun of -- of your pretty clothes ?
Eyolf . [ Evasively .
] No , they dare_ _n't -- for then I would thrash them .
Allmers .
Aha ! -- then why -- ?
Eyolf .
You see , they are so naughty , these boys .
And then they say I can never be a soldier .
Allmers . [ With suppressed indignation .
] Why do they say that , do you think ?
Eyolf .
I suppose they are jealous of me .
For you know , Papa , they are so poor , they have to go about barefoot .
] Oh , Rita -- how it wrings my heart !
Rita . [ Soothingly , rising .
] There , there , there !
Allmers . [ Threateningly .
] But these rascals shall soon find out who is the master down at the beach !
ASTA . [ Listening .
] There is some one knocking .
Eyolf .
Oh , I_ _m sure it_ _s Borgheim !
Rita .
Come in .
[ The Rat-wife comes softly and noiselessly in by the door on the right .
She is a thin little shrunken figure , old and grey-haired , with keen , piercing eyes , dressed in an old-fashioned flowered gown , with a black hood and cloak .
She has in her hand a large red umbrella , and carries a black bag by a loop over her arm. ]
Eyolf . [ Softly , taking hold of ASTA's dress .
] Auntie !
That must surely be her !
THE=RAT-WIFE . [ Curtseying at the door .
] I humbly beg pardon -- but are your worships troubled with any gnawing things in the house ?
Allmers .
Here ?
No , I do_ _n't think so .
THE=RAT-WIFE .
For it would be such a pleasure to me to rid your worships' house of them .
Rita .
Yes , yes ; we understand .
But we have nothing of the sort here .
THE=RAT-WIFE .
That's very unlucky , that is ;
for I just happened to be on my rounds now , and goodness knows when I may be in these parts again .
-- Oh , how tired I am !
Allmers . [ Pointing to a chair .
] Yes , you look tired .
THE=RAT-WIFE .
I know one ought never to get tired of doing good to the poor little things that are hated and persecuted so cruelly .
But it takes your strength out=of you , it does .
Rita .
Will_ _n't you sit down and rest a little ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
I thank your ladyship with all my heart . [ Seats herself on a chair between the door and the sofa . ] I have been out all night at my work .
Allmers .
Have you indeed ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Yes , over on the islands . [ With a chuckling laugh .
] The people sent for me , I can assure you .
They did_ _n't like it a=bit ;
but there was nothing=else to be done .
They had to put a good face on it , and bite the sour apple . [ Looks at Eyolf , and nods .
] The sour apple , little master , the sour apple .
] Why did they have to -- ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
What ?
Eyolf .
To bite it ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Why , because they could_ _n't keep body and soul together on=account=of the rats and all the little rat-children , you see , young master .
Rita .
Ugh !
Poor people ! Have they so many of them ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Yes , it was all alive and swarming with them . [ Laughs with quiet glee .
] They came creepy-crawly up into the beds all night long .
They plumped into the milk-cans , and they went pittering and pattering all=over the floor , backwards and forwards , and up=and=down .
Eyolf . [ Softly , to ASTA .
] I shall never go there , Auntie .
THE=RAT-WIFE .
But then I came -- I , and another along=with me .
And we took them with us , every one -- the sweet little creatures !
We made an end of every one of them .
Eyolf . [ With a shriek .
] Papa -- look ! look !
Rita .
Good Heavens , Eyolf !
Allmers .
What's the matter ?
Eyolf . [ Pointing .
] There's something wriggling in the bag !
Rita . [ At the extreme-left , shrieks .
] Ugh !
Send her away , Alfred .
THE=RAT-WIFE . [ Laughing .
] Oh , dearest lady , you needn't be frightened of such a little mannikin .
Allmers .
But what is the thing ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Why , it_ _s only little Mopseman . [ Loosening the string of the bag .
] Come up out=of the dark , my own little darling friend .
[ A little dog with a broad black snout pokes its head out=of the bag .
]
] Come along , do_ _n't be afraid , my little wounded warrior !
He will_ _n't bite .
Come here !
Come here !
Eyolf . [ Clinging to ASTA .
] No , I dare not .
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Do_ _n't you think he has a gentle , lovable countenance , my young master ?
Eyolf . [ Astonished , pointing .
] That thing there ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Yes , this thing here .
Eyolf . [ Almost under his breath , staring fixedly at the dog . ] I think he has the horriblest -- countenance I ever saw .
THE=RAT-WIFE . [ Closing the bag .
] Oh , it will come -- it will come , right enough .
Eyolf . [ Involuntarily drawing nearer , at=last goes right=up=to her , and strokes the bag .
] But he is lovely -- lovely all=the=same .
] But now he is so tired and weary , poor thing .
He_ _s utterly tired out , he is . [ Looks at Allmers .
] For it takes the strength out=of you , that sort of game , I can tell you , sir .
Allmers .
What sort of game do you mean ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
The luring game .
Allmers .
Do you mean that it is the dog that lures the rats ?
THE=RAT-WIFE . [ Nodding .
] Mopseman and I -- we two do it together .
And it goes so smoothly -- for all you can see , at=any=rate .
I just slip a string through his collar , and then I lead him three times round the house , and play on my Pan's-pipes .
When they hear that , they have got to come up from the cellars , and down from the garrets , and out=of flour boles , all the blessed little creatures .
Eyolf .
And does he bite them to death then ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Oh , not at=all !
No , we go down to the boat , he and I do -- and then they follow after us , both the big ones and the little ratikins .
Eyolf . [ Eagerly .
] And what then -- tell me !
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Then we push out from the land , and I scull with one oar , and play on my Pan's-pipes .
And Mopseman , he swims behind . [ With glittering eyes .
] And all the creepers and crawlers , they follow and follow us out into the deep , deep waters .
Ay , for they have to .
Eyolf .
Why do they have to ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Just because they want not to -- just because they are so deadly afraid of the water .
That is why they have got to plunge into it .
Eyolf .
Are they drowned , then ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Every blessed one . [ More softly .
] And there it is all as still , and soft , and dark as their hearts can desire , the lovely little things .
Down there they sleep a long , sweet sleep , with no=one to hate them or persecute them any=more . [ Rises .
] In the old days , I can tell you , I did_ _n't need any Mopseman .
Then I did the luring myself -- I alone .
Eyolf .
And what did you lure then ?
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Men .
One most=of=all .
Eyolf . [ With eagerness .
] Oh , who was that one ? Tell me !
THE=RAT-WIFE . [ Laughing .
] It was my own sweetheart , it was , little heart-breaker !
Eyolf .
And where is he now , then ?
THE=RAT-WIFE . [ Harshly .
] Down where all the rats are . [ Resuming her milder tone .
] But now I must be off and get to business again .
Always on the move . [ To Rita .
] So your ladyship has no sort of use for me to-day ?
I could finish it all off while I am about it .
Rita .
No , thank you ;
I do_ _n't think we require anything .
THE=RAT-WIFE .
Well , well , your sweet ladyship , you can never tell .
If your ladyship should find that there is anything lure that keeps nibbling and gnawing , and creeping and crawling , then just see and get hold of me and Mopseman .
-- Good-bye , good-bye , a kind good-bye to you all . [ She goes out by the door on the right .
]
] Only think , Auntie , now I have seen the Rat-Wife too !
[ Rita goes out upon the verandah , and fans herself with her pocket-handkerchief .
Shortly afterwards , Eyolf slips cautiously and unnoticed out to the right .
]
] Is this your portfolio , Asta ?
ASTA .
Yes . I have some of the old letters in it .
Allmers .
Ah , the family letters --
ASTA .
You know you asked me to arrange them for you while you were away .
] And you have actually found time to do that , dear ?
ASTA .
Oh , yes .
I have done it partly out here and partly at my own rooms in-town .
Allmers .
Thanks , dear .
Did you find anything particular in them ?
ASTA . [ Lightly .
] Oh , you know you always find something or other in such old papers . [ Speaking lower and seriously .
] It is the letters to mother that are in this portfolio .
Allmers .
Those , of=course , you must keep yourself .
ASTA . [ With an effort .
] No ;
I am determined that you shall look through them , too , Alfred .
Some time -- later on in life .
I have_ _n't the key of the portfolio with me just now .
Allmers .
It does_ _n't matter , my dear Asta , for I shall never read your mother's letters in any case .
ASTA . [ Fixing her eyes on him .
] Then some time or other -- some quiet evening -- I will tell you a little of what is in them .
Allmers .
Yes , that will be much better .
But do you keep your mother's letters -- you have_ _n't so many mementos of her .
[ He hands ASTA the portfolio .
Rita comes into the room again .
]
Rita .
Ugh ! I feel as=if that horrible old woman had brought a sort of graveyard smell with her .
Allmers .
Yes , she was rather horrible .
Rita .
I felt almost sick while she was in the room .
Allmers .
However , I can very well understand the sort of spellbound fascination that she talked about .
The loneliness of the mountain-peaks and of the great waste places has something of the same magic about it .
ASTA . [ Looks attentively at him .
] What is it that has happened to you , Alfred ?
Allmers . [ Smiling .
] To me ?
ASTA .
Yes , something has happened -- something seems almost to have transformed you .
Rita noticed it too .
Rita .
Yes , I saw it the moment you came .
A change for the better , I hope , Alfred ?
Allmers .
It ought=to be for the better .
And it must and shall come to good .
Rita . [ With an outburst .
] You have had some adventure on your journey !
Do_ _n't deny it !
I can see it in your face !
Allmers . [ Shaking his head .
] No adventure in the world -- outwardly at least .
But --
Rita . [ Eagerly .
] But -- ?
Allmers .
It is true that within me there has been something of a revolution .
Rita .
Oh Heavens -- !
] Only for the better , my dear Rita .
You may be perfectly certain of that .
] You must tell us all about it , at once -- tell us everything !
Allmers . [ Turning to ASTA .
] Yes , let us sit down , too , Asta .
Then I will try to tell you as=well=as I can .
[ He seats himself on the sofa at RITA's side .
ASTA moves a chair forward , and places herself near him .
]
Rita . [ Looking at him expectantly .
] Well -- ?
Allmers . [ Gazing straight before him .
] When=I look back over my life -- and my fortunes -- for the last ten or eleven years , it seems to me almost like a fairy-tale or a dream .
Do_ _n't you think so too , Asta ?
ASTA .
Yes , in many ways I think so .
Allmers . [ Continuing .
] When=I remember what we two used to be , Asta -- we two poor orphan children --
Rita . [ Impatiently .
] Oh , that is such an old , old story .
Allmers . [ Not listening to her .
] And now here I am in comfort and luxury .
I have been able to follow my vocation .
I have been able to work and study -- just as I had always longed to . [ Holds out his hand .
] And all this great -- this fabulous good fortune we owe to you , my dearest Rita .
Rita . [ Half playfully , half angrily , slaps his hand . ] Oh , I do wish you would stop talking like that .
Allmers .
I speak of it only as a sort of introduction .
Rita .
Then do skip the introduction !
Allmers .
Rita , -- you must not think it was the doctor's advice that drove me up=to the mountains .
ASTA .
Was it not , Alfred ?
Rita .
What was it , then ?
Allmers .
It was this : I found there was no=more peace for me , there in my study .
Rita .
No peace !
Why , who disturbed you ?
Allmers . [ Shaking his head .
] No=one from=without .
But I felt as=though I were positively abusing -- or , say rather , wasting -- my best powers -- frittering away the time .
ASTA . [ With wide eyes .
] When you were writing at your book ?
Allmers . [ Nodding .
] For=I can_ _not think that my powers are confined to that alone .
I must surely have it in me to do one or two other things as well .
Rita .
Was that what you sat there brooding over ?
Allmers .
Yes , mainly that .
Rita .
And so=that is what has made you so discontented with yourself of=late ;
and with the rest of us as=well .
For you know you were discontented , Alfred .
Allmers . [ Gazing straight before him .
H'm !
ASTA . [ Laying her hand upon his arm. ] But , Alfred -- that book is to be your life-work .
Rita .
Yes , you have said so often enough .
Allmers .
I thought so .
Ever=since I grew up , I have thought so . [ With an affectionate expression in his eyes .
] And it was you that enabled me to devote myself to it , my dear Rita --
Rita .
Oh , nonsense !
Allmers . [ Smiling to her .
] -- you , with your gold , and your green forests --
] If you begin all that rubbish again , I shall beat you .
ASTA . [ Looking sorrowfully at him .
] But the book , Alfred ?
Allmers .
It began , as it were , to drift away from me .
But I was more and more beset by the thought of the higher duties that laid their claims upon me .
] Alfred !
Allmers .
Rita . [ Disappointed , drops his hand . ] Ah -- of Eyolf !
Allmers .
Poor little Eyolf has taken deeper and deeper hold of me .
After that unlucky fall from the table -- and especially since we have been assured that the injury is incurable --
Rita . [ Insistently .
] But you take all the care you possibly can of him , Alfred !
Allmers .
As a schoolmaster , yes ;
but not as a father .
And it is a father that I want henceforth to be to Eyolf .
] I do_ _n't think I quite understand you .
Allmers .
I mean that I will try with all my might to make his misfortune as painless and easy to him as it can possibly be .
Rita .
Oh , but , dear -- thank Heaven , I do_ _n't think he feels it so deeply .
ASTA . [ With emotion .
] Yes , Rita , he does .
Allmers .
Yes , you may be sure he feels it deeply .
Rita . [ Impatiently .
] But , Alfred , what more can you do for him ?
Allmers .
I will try to perfect all the rich possibilities that are dawning in his childish soul .
I will foster all the germs of good in his nature -- make them blossom and bear fruit . [ With more=and=more warmth , rising .
] And=I will do more=than that !
I will help him to bring his desires into harmony with what lies attainable before him .
That is just what at=present they are not .
All his longings are for things that must for=ever remain unattainable to him .
But I will create a conscious happiness in his mind . [ He goes once=or=twice up=and=down the room .
ASTA and Rita follow him with their eyes .
]
Rita .
You should take these things more quietly , Alfred !
Allmers . [ Stops beside the table on the left , and looks at them .
] Eyolf shall carry on my life-work -- if he wants to .
Or he shall choose one that is altogether his own .
Perhaps that would be best .
At all events , I shall let mine rest as it is .
Rita . [ Rising .
] But , Alfred dear , can you not work both for yourself and for Eyolf ?
Allmers .
No , I can_ _not .
It is impossible !
I can_ _not divide myself in this matter -- and therefore I efface myself .
Eyolf shall be the complete man of our race . And it shall be my new life-work to make him the complete man .
ASTA . [ Has risen and now goes up=to him . ] This must have cost you a terribly hard struggle , Alfred ?
Allmers .
Yes , it has .
At home here , I should never have conquered myself , never brought myself to the point of renunciation .
Never at home !
Rita .
Then that was why you went away this summer ?
Allmers . [ With shining eyes .
] Yes !
I went up into the infinite solitudes .
I saw the sunrise gleaming on the mountain peaks .
I felt myself nearer the stars -- I seemed almost to be in sympathy and communion with them .
And then I found the strength for it .
ASTA . [ Looking sadly at him .
] But you will never write any=more of your book on « Human=Responsibility » ?
Allmers .
No , never , Asta .
I tell you I can_ _not split up my life between two vocations .
But I will act out my « human responsibility » -- in my own life .
Rita . [ With a smile .
] Do you think you can live up=to such high resolves at home here ?
Allmers . [ Taking her hand .
] With you to help me , I can . [ Holds out the other hand .
] And with you too , Asta .
Rita . [ Drawing her hand away .
] Ah -- with both of us !
So , after all , you can divide yourself .
Allmers .
Why , my dearest Rita -- !
[ Rita moves away from him and stands in the garden doorway .
A light and rapid knock is heard at the door on the right .
Engineer=BORGHEIM enters quickly .
He is a young man of a little over thirty .
His expression is bright and cheerful , and he holds himself erect .
]
Borgheim .
Good morning , Mrs.=Allmers . [ Stops with an expression of pleasure on seeing Allmers .
] Why , what's this ?
Home again already , Mr. Allmers ?
Allmers . [ Shaking hands with him .
] Yes , I arrived list night .
Rita . [ Gaily .
] His leave was up , Mr.=Borgheim .
Allmers .
No , you know it was_ _n't , Rita --
Rita . [ Approaching .
] Oh yes , but it was , though .
His furlough had run out .
Borgheim .
I see you hold your husband well in-hand , Mrs.=Allmers .
Rita .
I hold to my rights .
And besides , everything must have an end .
Borgheim .
Oh , not everything -- I hope .
Good morning , Miss=Allmers !
ASTA . [ Holding aloof from him .
] Good morning .
Rita . [ Looking at Borgheim .
] Not everything , you say ?
Borgheim .
Oh , I am firmly convinced that there are some things in the world that will never come to an end .
Rita .
I suppose you are thinking of love -- and that sort of thing .
Borgheim . [ Warmly .
] I am thinking of all that is lovely !
Rita .
And that never comes to an end .
Yes , let us think of that , hope for that , all of us .
Allmers . [ Coming up=to them .
] I suppose you will soon have finished your road-work out here ?
Borgheim .
I have finished it already -- finished it yesterday .
It has been a long business , but , thank Heaven , that has come to an end .
Rita .
And you are beaming with joy over that ?
Borgheim .
Yes , I am indeed !
Rita .
Well , I must say --
Borgheim .
What , Mrs.=Allmers ?
Rita .
I do_ _n't think it is particularly nice of you , Mr.=Borgheim .
Borgheim .
Indeed !
Why not ?
Rita .
Well , I suppose we sha'n't often see you in these parts after this .
Borgheim .
No , that is true .
I had_ _n't thought of that .
Rita .
Oh well , I suppose you will be able to look in upon us now and then all=the=same .
Borgheim .
No , unfortunately that will be out=of my power for a very long time .
Allmers .
Indeed !
How so ?
Borgheim .
The fact is , I have got a big piece of new work that I must set about at=once .
Allmers .
Have you indeed ?
-- [ Pressing his hand . ] -- I am heartily glad to hear it .
Rita .
I congratulate you , Mr.=Borgheim !
Borgheim .
Hush , hush -- I really ought not to talk openly of it as yet !
But I can_ _n't help coming out with it !
It is a great piece of road-making -- up in the north -- with mountain ranges to cross , and the most tremendous difficulties to overcome !
-- [ With an outburst of gladness .
] -- Oh , what a glorious world this is -- and what a joy it is to be a road-maker in it !
] Is it road-making business that has brought you out here to-day in such wild spirits ?
Borgheim .
No , not that alone .
I am thinking of all the bright and hopeful prospects that are opening out before me .
Rita .
Aha , then perhaps you have something still more exquisite in reserve !
Borgheim . [ Glancing towards ASTA .
] Who knows !
When once happiness comes to us , it is apt to come like it spring flood . [ Turns to ASTA .
] Miss Allmers , would you not like to take a little walk with me ?
As we used to ?
ASTA . [ Quickly .
] No -- no , thank you .
Not now .
Not to-day .
Borgheim .
Oh , do come !
Only a little bit of a walk !
I have so much I want to talk to you about before I go .
Rita .
Something=else , perhaps , that you must not talk openly about as yet ?
Borgheim .
H'm , that depends --
Rita .
But there is nothing to prevent your whispering , you know . [ Half aside . ] Asta , you must really go with him .
ASTA .
But , my dear Rita --
Borgheim . [ Imploringly .
ASTA . [ Takes her hat and parasol . ] Very well , suppose we take a stroll in the garden , then .
Borgheim .
Oh , thank you , thank you !
Allmers .
And while you are there you can see what Eyolf is doing .
Borgheim .
Ah , Eyolf , by the bye !
Where is Eyolf to-day ?
I_ _ve got something for him .
Allmers .
He is out playing somewhere .
Borgheim .
Is he really !
Then he has begun to play now ?
He used always to be sitting indoors over his books .
Allmers .
There is to be an end of that now .
I am going to make a regular open-air boy of him .
Borgheim .
Ah , now , that_ _s right !
Out into the open air with him , poor little fellow !
Good Lord , what can we possibly do better than play in this blessed world ?
For my part , I think all life is one long playtime !
-- Come , Miss=Asta !
[ Borgheim and ASTA go out on the verandah and down through the garden .
]
Allmers . [ Stands looking after them .
] Rita -- do you think there is anything between those two ?
Rita .
I do_ _n't know what to say .
I used to think there was .
But Asta has grown so strange to me -- so utterly incomprehensible of=late .
Allmers .
Indeed !
Has she ?
While I have been away ?
Rita .
Yes , within the last week or two .
Allmers .
And you think she does_ _n't care very much about him now ?
Rita .
Not , seriously ;
not utterly and entirely ;
not unreservedly -- I am sure she does_ _n't . [ Looks searchingly at him .
] Would it displease you if she did ?
Allmers .
It would not exactly displease me .
But it would certainly be a disquieting thought --
Rita .
Disquieting ?
Allmers .
Yes ; you must remember that I am responsible for Asta -- for her life's happiness .
Rita .
Oh , come -- responsible !
Surely=Asta has come to years of discretion ?
I should say she was capable of choosing for herself .
Allmers .
Yes , we must hope so , Rita .
Rita .
For my part , I do_ _n't think at=all ill of Borgheim .
Allmers .
No , dear -- no=more do I -- quite the contrary .
But all=the=same --
Rita . [ Continuing .
] And=I should be very glad indeed if he and Asta were to make a match of it .
Allmers . [ Annoyed .
] Oh , why should you be ?
Rita . [ With increasing excitement .
] Why , for then she would have to go far , far away with him !
Anal she could never come out here to us , as she does now .
] What !
Can you really wish Asta to go away ?
Rita .
Yes , yes , Alfred !
Allmers .
Why in all the world -- ?
Rita . [ Throwing her arms passionately round his neck . ] For then , at last , I should have you to myself alone !
And yet -- not even then !
Not wholly to myself ! [ Bursts into convulsive weeping .
] Oh , Alfred , Alfred -- I can_ _not give you up !
Allmers . [ Gently releasing himself .
] My dearest Rita , do be reasonable !
Rita .
I do_ _n't care a=bit about being reasonable !
I care only for you !
Only for you in all the world ! [ Again throwing her arms round his neck .
] For you , for you , for you !
Allmers .
Let me go , let me go -- you are strangling me !
Rita . [ Letting him go .
] How=I wish I could ! [ Looking at him with flashing eyes .
] Oh , if you knew how I have hated you -- !
Allmers .
Hated me -- !
Rita .
Yes -- when you shut yourself up in your room and brooded over your work -- till long , long into the night . [ Plaintively .
] So long , so late , Alfred .
Oh , how I hated your work !
Allmers .
But now I have done with that .
Rita . [ With a cutting laugh .
] Oh yes !
Now you have given yourself up=to something worse .
Allmers . [ Shocked .
] Worse !
Do you call our child something worse ?
Rita . [ Vehemently .
] Yes , I do .
As he comes between you and me , I call him so .
For the book -- the book was not a living being , as the child is . [ With increasing impetuosity .
] But=I will_ _n't endure it , Alfred !
I will not endure it -- I tell you so plainly !
] I am often almost afraid of you , Rita .
Rita . [ Gloomily .
] I am often afraid of myself .
And for that very reason you must not awake the evil in me .
Allmers .
Why , good Heavens , do I do that ?
Rita .
Yes , you do -- when you tear to shreds the holiest bonds between us .
Allmers . [ Urgently .
] Think what you_ _re saying , Rita .
It is your own child -- our only child , that you are speaking of .
Rita .
The child is only half mine . [ With another outburst .
] But you shall be mine alone !
You shall be wholly mine !
That I have a right to demand of you !
Allmers . [ Shrugging his shoulders .
] Oh , my dear Rita , it is of no use demanding anything .
Everything must be freely given .
Rita . [ Looks anxiously at him .
] And that you can_ _not do henceforth ?
Allmers .
No , I can_ _not .
I must divide myself between Eyolf and you .
Rita .
But if Eyolf had never been born ?
What then ?
Allmers . [ Evasively .
] Oh , that would be another matter .
Then I should have only you to care for .
Rita . [ Softly , her voice quivering .
] Then=I wish he had never been born .
Allmers . [ Flashing out .
] Rita ! You do_ _n't know what you are saying !
Rita . [ Trembling with emotion .
] It was in pain unspeakable that I brought him into the world .
But I bore it all with joy and rapture for your sake .
Allmers . [ Warmly .
] Oh yes , I know , I know .
Rita . [ With decision .
] But there it must end .
I will live my life -- together with you -- wholly with you .
I can_ _not go on being only Eyolf's mother -- only his mother and nothing more .
I will not , I tell you !
I can_ _not !
I will be all=in=all to you !
To you , Alfred !
Allmers .
But that is just what you are , Rita .
Through our child --
Rita .
Oh -- vapid , nauseous phrases -- nothing=else !
No , Alfred , I am not to be put off like that .
I was fitted to become the child's mother , but not to be a mother to him .
You must take me as I am , Alfred .
Allmers .
And yet you used to be so fond of Eyolf .
Rita .
I was so sorry for him -- because you troubled yourself so little about him .
You kept him reading and grinding at books .
You scarcely even saw him .
Allmers . [ Nodding slowly .
] No ;
I was blind .
The time had not=yet come for me --
Rita . [ Looking in his face .
] But now , I suppose , it has come ?
Allmers .
Yes , at , last .
Now I see that the highest task I can have in the world is to be a true father to Eyolf .
Rita .
And to me ?
-- what will you be to me ?
Allmers . [ Gently .
] I will always go on caring for you -- with calm , deep tenderness . [ He tries to take her hands .
]
Rita . [ Evading him .
] I do_ _n't care a=bit for your calm , deep tenderness .
I want you utterly and entirely -- and alone !
Just as I had you in the first rich , beautiful days . [ Vehemently and harshly .
] Never , never will I consent to be put off with scraps and leavings , Alfred !
Allmers . [ In a conciliatory tone .
] I should have thought there was happiness in plenty for all three of us , Rita .
Rita . [ Scornfully .
] Then you are easy to please . [ Seats herself at the table on the left .
] Now listen to me .
Allmers . [ Approaching .
] Well , what is it ?
Rita . [ Looking up at him with a veiled glow in her eyes . ] When=I got your telegram yesterday evening --
Allmers .
Yes ?
What then ?
Rita .
-- then I dressed myself in white --
Allmers .
Yes , I noticed you were in white when I arrived .
Rita .
I had let down my hair --
Allmers .
Your sweet masses of hair --
Rita .
-- so=that it flowed down my neck and shoulders --
Allmers .
I saw it , I saw it .
Oh , how lovely you were , Rita !
Rita .
There were rose-tinted shades over both the lamps .
And we were alone , we two -- the only waking beings in the whole house .
And there was champagne on the table .
Allmers .
I did not drink any of it .
Rita . [ Looking bitterly at him .
] No , that is true . [ Laughs harshly .
] « There stood the champagne , but you tasted it not » -- as the poet says .
[ She rises from the armchair , goes with an air of weariness over to the sofa , and seats herself , half reclining , upon it .
]
] I was so taken up with serious thoughts .
I had made up my mind to talk to you of our future , Rita -- and first and foremost of Eyolf .
Rita . [ Smiling .
] And so you did --
Allmers .
No , I had not time to -- for you began to undress .
Rita .
Yes , and meanwhile you talked about Eyolf .
Do_ _n't you remember ?
You wanted to know all about little Eyolf's digestion .
Allmers . [ Looking reproachfully at her .
] Rita -- !
Rita .
And then you got into your bed , and slept the sleep of the just .
Allmers . [ Shaking his head .
] Rita -- Rita !
Rita . [ Lying at full length and looking up at him .
] Alfred ?
Allmers .
Yes ?
Rita .
« There stood your champagne , but you tasted it not . »
Allmers . [ Almost harshly .
] No. I did not taste it .
[ He goes away from her and stands in the garden doorway .
Rita lies for some time motionless , with closed eyes .
]
Rita . [ Suddenly springing up .
] But let me tell you one thing , Alfred .
Allmers . [ Turning in the doorway .
] Well ?
Rita .
You ought not to feel quite so secure as you do !
Allmers .
Not secure ?
Rita .
No , you ought not to be so indifferent !
Not certain of your property in me !
Allmers . [ Drawing nearer .
] What do you mean by that ?
Rita . [ With trembling lips .
] Never in a single thought have I been untrue to you , Alfred !
Never for an instant .
Allmers .
No , Rita , I know that -- I , who know you so well .
Rita . [ With sparkling eyes .
] But if you disdain me -- !
Allmers .
Disdain !
I do_ _n't understand what you mean !
Rita .
Oh , you do_ _n't know all that might rise up within me , if --
Allmers .
If ?
Rita .
If I should ever see that you did not care for me -- that you did not love me as you used to .
Allmers .
But , my dearest Rita -- years bring a certain change with them -- and that must one day occur even in us -- as=in every one else .
Rita .
Never in me !
And I will not hear of any change in you either -- I could not bear it , Alfred .
I want to keep you to myself alone .
] You have a terribly jealous nature --
Rita .
I can_ _n't make myself different from what I am . [ Threateningly .
] If you go and divide yourself between me and any one else --
Allmers .
What then -- ?
Rita .
Then I will take my revenge on you , Alfred !
Allmers .
How « take your revenge » ?
Rita .
I do_ _n't know how .
-- Oh yes , I do know , well enough !
Allmers .
Well ?
Rita .
I will go and throw myself away --
Allmers .
Throw yourself away , do you say ?
Rita .
Yes , that I will .
I_ _ll throw myself straight into the arms of of the first man that comes in my way --
] That you will never do -- my loyal , proud , true-hearted Rita !
] Oh , you do_ _n't know what I might come to be if you -- if you did not love me any=more .
Allmers .
Did not love you , Rita ?
How can you say such a thing !
] Why should I not spread my nets for that -- that road-maker man that hangs about here ?
Allmers . [ Relieved .
] Oh , thank goodness -- you are only joking .
Rita .
Not at=all .
He would do as=well=as any one else .
Allmers .
Ah , but I suspect he is more=or=less taken up already .
Rita .
So much the better !
For then I should take him away from some one else ;
and that is just what Eyolf has done to me .
Allmers .
Can you say that our little Eyolf has done that ?
Rita . [ Pointing with her forefinger .
] There , you see !
You see !
The moment you mention Eyolf's name , you grow tender and your voice quivers ! [ Threateningly , clenching her hands .
] Oh , you almost tempt we to wish --
Allmers . [ Looking at her anxiously .
] What do I tempt you to wish , Rita ?
--
Rita . [ Vehemently , going away from him . ] No , no , no -- I will_ _n't tell you that !
Never !
Allmers . [ Drawing nearer to her .
] Rita ! I implore you -- for my sake and for your own -- do not let yourself he tempted into evil .
[ Borgheim and ASTA come up from the garden .
They both show signs of restrained emotion . They look serious and dejected .
ASTA remains out on the verandah .
Borgheim comes into the room .
]
Borgheim .
So=that is over -- Miss=Allmers and I have had our last walk together .
] Ah !
And there is no=longer journey to follow the walk ?
Borgheim .
Yes , for me .
Rita .
For you alone ?
Borgheim .
Yes , for me alone .
Rita . [ Glances darkly at Allmers .
] Do you hear that ? [ Turns to Borgheim .
] I_ _ll wager it is some one with the evil eye that has played you this trick .
Borgheim . [ Looks at her .
] The evil eye ?
Rita . [ Nodding .
] Yes , the evil eye .
Borgheim .
Do you believe in the evil eye , Mrs.=Allmers ?
Rita .
Yes . I have begun to believe in the evil eye .
Especially in a child's evil eye .
Allmers . [ Shocked , whispers .
] Rita -- how can you -- ?
Rita . [ Speaking low .
] It is you that make me so wicked and hateful , Alfred .
[ Confused cries and shrieks are heard in the distance , from the direction of the fiord .
]
] What noise is that ? ASTA . [ In the doorway .
] Look at all those people running down to the pier !
Allmers .
What can it be ? [ Looks out for a moment .
] No doubt it_ _s those street urchins at some mischief again . Borgheim . [ Calls , leaning over the verandah railings .
] I say , you boys down there !
What's the matter ?
[ Several voices are heard answering indistinctly and confusedly .
]
Rita .
What do they say ?
Borgheim .
They say it_ _s a child that_ _s drowned .
Allmers .
A child drowned ?
ASTA . [ Uneasily .
] A little boy , they say .
Allmers .
Oh , they can all swim , every one of them .
Rita . [ Shrieks in terror .
] Where is Eyolf ?
Allmers .
Keep quiet -- quiet .
Eyolf is down in the garden , playing .
ASTA .
No , he was_ _n't in the garden .
Rita . [ With upstretched arms .
] Oh , if only it is_ _n't he !
] Whose child is it , do you say ?
[ Indistinct voices are heard .
Borgheim and ASTA utter a suppressed cry , and rush out through the garden .
]
] It is_ _n't Eyolf !
It is_ _n't Eyolf , Rita !
Rita . [ On the verandah , listening . ] Hush !
Be quiet !
Let me hear what they are saying !
[ Rita rushes back with a piercing shriek , into the room .
]
Allmers . [ Following her .
] What did they say ?
Allmers . [ Almost paralysed .
] No !
No !
No !
Rita . [ Hoarsely .
] Eyolf !
Eyolf !
Oh , but they must save him !
Allmers . [ Half distracted .
] They must , they must !
So precious a life !
[ He rushes down through the garden .
]
Act Second
[ A little narrow glen by the side of the fiord , on Allmers's property .
On the left , lofty old trees overarch the spot .
Down the slope in the background a brook comes leaping , and loses itself among the stones on the margin of the wood .
A path winds along by the brook-side .
To the right there are only a=few single trees , between which the fiord is visible .
In=front is seen the corner of a boat-shed with a boat drawn up .
Under the old trees on the left stands a table with a bench and one or two chairs , all made of thin birch-staves .
It is a heavy , damp day , with driving mist wreaths .
]
[ Alfred Allmers , dressed as before , sits on the bench , leaning his arms on the table .
His hat lies before him .
He gazes absently and immovably out over the water .
]
[ Presently Asta=allmers comes down the woodpath .
She is carrying an open umbrella .
]
ASTA . [ Closing her umbrella .
Allmers . [ Without expression .
] Thank you .
] Have you been sitting here long ?
All=the=time ?
Allmers . [ Does not answer at=first .
Presently he says .
] No , I can_ _not grasp it .
It seems so utterly impossible .
ASTA . [ Laying her hand compassionately on his arm. ] Poor=Alfred !
Allmers . [ Gazing at her .
] Is it really true then , Asta ?
Or have I gone mad ?
Or am I only dreaming ?
Oh , if it were only a dream !
Just think , if I were to waken now !
ASTA .
Oh , if I could only waken you !
] How pitiless the fiord looks to-day , lying so heavy and drowsy -- leaden-grey -- with splashes of yellow -- and reflecting the rain-clouds .
ASTA . [ Imploringly .
] Oh , Alfred , do_ _n't sit staring out over the fiord !
Allmers . [ Not heeding her .
] Over the surface , yes .
But in the depths -- there sweeps the rushing undertow --
ASTA . [ In terror .
] Oh , for God's sake do_ _n't think of the depths !
Allmers . [ Looking gently at her .
] I suppose you think he is lying close outside here ?
But he is not , Asta .
You must not think that .
You must remember how fiercely the current sweeps gut here straight to the open sea .
] Oh , God ! Oh , God !
Allmers . [ Heavily .
] So you see , little Eyolf has passed so=far -- far-away from us now .
] Oh , Alfred , do_ _n't say such things !
Allmers .
Why , you can reckon it out for yourself -- you that are so clever .
In eight-and-twenty hours -- nine-and-twenty hours -- Let me see -- ! Let me see -- !
ASTA . [ Shrieking and stopping her ears .
] Alfred !
] Can you conceive the meaning of a thing like this ?
ASTA . [ Looks at him .
] Of what ?
Allmers .
Of this that has been done to Rita and me .
ASTA .
The meaning of it ?
Allmers . [ Impatiently .
] Yes , the meaning , I say .
For , after all , there must be a meaning in it .
Life , existence -- destiny , can_ _not be so utterly meaningless .
ASTA .
Oh , who can say anything with certainty about these things , my dear Alfred ?
Allmers . [ Laughs bitterly .
] No , no ;
I believe you are right there .
Perhaps the whole thing goes simply by hap-hazard -- taking its own course , like a drifting wreck without a rudder .
I daresay that is how it is .
At=least , it seems very like it .
ASTA . [ Thoughtfully .
] What if it only seems -- ?
Allmers . [ Vehemently .
] Ah ?
Perhaps you can unravel the mystery for me ?
I certainly can_ _not . [ More gently .
] Here is Eyolf , just entering upon conscious life : full of such infinite possibilities -- splendid possibilities perhaps : he would have filled my life with pride and gladness .
And then a crazy old woman has only to come this way -- and show a cur in a bag --
ASTA .
But we do_ _n't in the least know how it really happened .
Allmers .
Yes , we do .
The boys saw her row out over the fiord .
They saw Eyolf standing alone at the very end of the pier .
They saw him gazing after her -- and then he seemed to turn giddy . [ Quivering .
] And that was how he fell over -- and disappeared .
ASTA .
Yes , yes .
But all=the=same --
Allmers .
She has drawn him down into the depths -- that you may be sure of , dear .
ASTA .
But , Alfred , why should she ?
Allmers .
Yes , that is just the question !
Why should she ?
There is no retribution behind it all -- no atonement , I mean .
Eyolf never did her any harm .
He never called names after her ;
he never threw stones at her dog .
Why , he had never set eyes either on her or her dog till yesterday .
So there is no retribution ;
the whole thing is utterly groundless and meaningless , Asta .
-- And yet the order of the world requires it .
ASTA .
Have you spoken to Rita of these things ?
Allmers . [ Shakes his head .
] I feel as=if I can talk better to you about them . [ Drawing a deep breath .
] And about everything=else as=well .
[ ASTA takes serving-materials and a=little paper parcel out=of her pocket .
Allmers sits looking on absently .
]
Allmers .
What leave you got there , Asta ?
ASTA . [ Taking his hat . ] Some black crap .
Allmers .
Oh , whet is the use of that ?
ASTA .
Rita asked me to put it on .
May I ?
Allmers .
Oh , yes ;
as=far=as I_ _m concerned -- [ She sews the crape on his hat .
]
] Where is Rita ?
ASTA .
She is walking about the garden a little , I think .
Borgheim is with her .
Allmers . [ Slightly surprised .
] Indeed !
Is=Borgheim out here to-day again ?
ASTA .
Yes .
He came out by the mid-day train .
Allmers .
I did_ _n't expect that .
ASTA . [ Serving .
] He was so fond of Eyolf .
Allmers .
Borgheim is a faithful soul , Asta .
ASTA . [ With quiet warmth .
] Yes , faithful he is , indeed .
That is certain .
] You are really fond of him ?
ASTA .
Yes , I am .
Allmers .
And yet you can_ _not make up your mind to -- ?
ASTA . [ Interrupting .
] Oh , my dear Alfred , do_ _n't talk of that !
Allmers .
Yes , yes ; tell me why you can_ _not ?
ASTA .
Oh , no !
Please !
You really must not ask me .
You see , it_ _s so painful for me .
-- There now !
The hat is done .
Allmers .
Thank you .
ASTA .
And now for the left arm.
Allmers .
Am I to have crape on it too ?
ASTA .
Yes , that is the custom .
Allmers .
Well -- as you please .
[ She moves close up=to him and begins to sew .
]
ASTA .
Keep your arm still -- then I will_ _n't prick you .
Allmers . [ With a half-smile .
] This is like the old days .
ASTA .
Yes , do_ _n't you think so ?
Allmers .
When you were a little girl you used to sit just like this , mending my clothes .
The first thing you ever sewed for me -- that was black crape , too .
ASTA .
Was it ?
Allmers .
Round my student's cap -- at the time of father's death .
ASTA .
Could I sew then ?
Fancy , I have forgotten it .
Allmers .
Oh , you were such a little thing then .
ASTA .
Yes , I was little then .
Allmers .
And then , two years afterwards -- when we lost your mother -- then again you sewed a big crape band on my sleeve .
ASTA .
I thought it was the right thing to do .
Allmers . [ Patting her hand .
] Yes , yes , it was the right thing to do , Asta .
And then when we were left alone in the world , we two -- .
Are you done already ?
ASTA .
Yes . [ Putting together her sewing-materials . ] It was really a beautiful time for us , Alfred .
We two alone .
Allmers .
Yes , it was -- though we had to toil so hard .
ASTA .
You toiled .
Allmers . [ With more life .
] Oh , you toiled too , in your way , I can assure you -- [ smiling ] -- my dear , faithful -- Eyolf .
ASTA .
Oh -- you must_ _n't remind me of that stupid nonsense about the name .
Allmers .
Well , if you had been a boy , you would have been called Eyolf .
ASTA .
Yes , if !
But when you began to go to college -- . [ Smiling involuntarily .
] I wonder how you could be so childish .
Allmers .
Was it I that was childish ?
ASTA .
Yes , indeed , I think it was , as I look back upon it all .
You were ashamed of having no brother -- only a sister .
Allmers .
No , no , it was you , dear -- you were ashamed .
ASTA .
Oh yes , I too , perhaps -- a little .
And somehow or other I was sorry for you --
Allmers .
Yes , I believe you were .
And then you hunted up some of my old boy's clothes --
ASTA .
Your fine Sunday clothes -- yes .
Do you remember the blue blouse and knickerbockers ?
] I remember so well how you looked when you used to wear them .
ASTA .
Only when we were at-home , alone , though .
Allmers .
And how serious we were , dear , and how mightily pleased with ourselves .
I always called you Eyolf .
ASTA .
Oh , Alfred , I hope you have never told Rita this ?
Allmers .
Yes , I believe I did once tell her .
ASTA .
Oh , Alfred , how could you do that ?
Allmers .
Well , you see -- one tells one's wife everything -- very nearly .
ASTA .
Yes , I suppose one does .
ASTA . [ Rising , looks sorrowfully at him . ] What is the matter ?
Allmers .
He had almost passed away from me .
He had passed quite away .
ASTA .
Eyolf !
Allmers .
Here I sat , living in these recollections -- and he had no part in them .
ASTA .
Yes , Alfred -- little Eyolf was behind it all .
Allmers .
No , he was not .
He slipped out=of my memory -- out=of my thoughts .
I did not see him for a moment as we sat here talking .
I utterly forgot him all that time .
ASTA .
But surely you must take some rest in your sorrow .
Allmers .
No , no , no ;
that is just what I will not do !
I must not -- I have no right -- and no heart for it , either . [ Going in great excitement towards the right .
] All my thoughts must be out=there , where he lies drifting in the depths !
] Alfred -- Alfred !
Do_ _n't go to the fiord .
Allmers .
I must go out to him !
Let me go , Asta !
I will take the boat .
ASTA . [ In terror .
] Do_ _n't go to the fiord , I say !
Allmers . [ Yielding .
] No , no -- I will not .
Only let me alone .
ASTA . [ Leading him back to the table . ] You must rest from your thoughts , Alfred .
Come here and sit down .
] Well , well -- as you please .
ASTA .
No , I will_ _n't let you sit there .
Allmers .
Yes , let me .
ASTA .
No , do_ _n't .
For then you will only sit looking out -- [ Forces him down upon a chair , with his back to the right .
] There now .
Now that_ _s right . [ Seats herself upon the bench .
] And now we can talk a little again .
] It was good to deaden the sorrow and heartache for a moment .
ASTA .
You insist do so , Alfred .
Allmers .
But do_ _n't you think it is terribly weak and unfeeling of me -- to be able to do so ?
ASTA .
Oh , no -- I am sure it is impossible to keep circling for=ever round one fixed thought .
Allmers .
Yes , for me it is impossible .
Before you came to me , here I sat , torturing myself unspeakably with this crushing , gnawing sorrow --
ASTA .
Yes ?
Allmers .
And would you believe it , Asta -- ? H'm --
ASTA .
Well ?
Allmers .
In the midst of all the agony , I found myself speculating what we should have for dinner to-day .
ASTA . [ Soothingly .
] Well , well , if only it rests you to --
Allmers .
Yes , just fancy , dear -- it seemed as=if it did give me rest . [ Holds out , his hand to her across the table .
] How good it is , Asta , that I have you with me . I am so glad of that .
Glad , glad -- even in my sorrow .
ASTA . [ Looking earnestly at him .
] You ought most=of=all to be glad that you have Rita .
Allmers .
Yes , of=course I should .
But Rita is no kin to me -- it is_ _n't like having a sister .
ASTA . [ Eagerly .
] Do you say that , Alfred ?
Allmers .
Yes , our family is a thing apart . [ Half jestingly .
] We have always had vowels for our initials .
Do_ _n't you remember how often we used to speak of that ?
And all our relations -- all equally poor .
And we have all=the=same colour of eyes .
ASTA .
Do you think I have -- ?
Allmers .
No , you take entirely after your mother .
You are not in the least like the rest of us -- not even like father .
But all=the=same --
ASTA .
All=the=same -- ?
Allmers .
Well , I believe that living together has , as it were , stamped us in each other's image -- mentally , I mean .
ASTA . [ With warm emotion .
] Oh , you must never say that , Alfred .
It is only I that have taken my stamp from you ;
and it is to you that I owe everything -- every good thing in the world .
Allmers . [ Shaking his head .
] You owe me nothing , Asta .
On=the=contrary --
ASTA .
I owe you everything !
You must never doubt that .
No sacrifice has been too great for you --
Allmers . [ Interrupting .
] Oh , nonsense -- sacrifice !
Do_ _n't talk of such a thing .
-- I have only loved you , Asta , ever=since you were a little child . [ After a short pause .
] And then it always seemed to me that I had so much injustice to make up to you for .
ASTA . [ Astonished .
] Injustice ?
You ?
Allmers .
Not precisely on my own account .
But --
ASTA . [ Eagerly .
] But -- ?
Allmers .
On father's .
ASTA . [ Half rising from the bench .
] On -- father's ! [ Sitting down again . ] What do you mean by that , Alfred ?
Allmers .
Father was never really kind to you .
ASTA . [ Vehemently .
] Oh , do_ _n't say that !
Allmers .
Yes , it is true .
He did not love you -- not as he ought=to have .
ASTA . [ Evasively .
] No , perhaps not as he loved you .
That was only natural .
Allmers . [ Continuing .
] And he was often hard to your mother , too -- at least in the last years .
ASTA . [ Softly .
] Mother was so much , much younger than he -- remember that .
Allmers .
Do you think they were not=quite suited to each=other ?
ASTA .
Perhaps not .
Allmers .
Yes , but still -- .
Father , who in other ways was so gentle and warm-hearted -- so kindly towards every one --
ASTA . [ Quietly .
] Mother , too , was not always as she ought=to have been .
Allmers .
Your mother was not !
ASTA .
Perhaps not always .
Allmers .
Towards father , do you mean ?
ASTA .
Yes .
Allmers .
I never noticed that .
ASTA . [ Struggling with her tears , rises .
] Oh , my dear Alfred -- let them rest -- those who are gone . [ She goes towards the right .
]
Allmers . [ Rising .
] Yes , let them rest . [ Wringing his hands .
] But those who are gone -- it is they that will_ _n't let us rest , Asta .
Neither day nor night .
ASTA . [ Looks warmly at him .
] Time will make it all seem easier , Alfred .
Allmers . [ Looking helplessly at her .
] Yes , do_ _n't you think it will ?
-- But how I am to get over these terrible first days [ Hoarsely .
] -- that is what I can_ _not imagine .
ASTA . [ Imploringly , laying her hands on his shoulders . ] Go up=to Rita .
Oh , please do --
] No , no , no -- do_ _n't talk to me of that !
I can_ _not , I tell you . [ More calmly .
] Let me remain here , with you .
ASTA .
Well , I will not leave you .
] Thank you for that ! [ Looks out for a time over the fiord .
] Where is my little Eyolf now ? [ Smiling sadly to her .
] Can you tell me that my big , wise Eyolf ? [ Shaking his head .
] No=one in all the world can tell me that .
ASTA . [ Looking up=to the left , and withdrawing her hand .
] Here they are coming . [ Mrs .
Allmers and Engineer=BORGHEIM come down by the wood-path , she leading the way .
She wears a dark dress and a black veil over her head .
He has an umbrella under his arm. ]
Allmers . [ Going to meet her .
] How is it with you , Rita ?
Rita . [ Passing him .
] Oh , do_ _n't ask .
Allmers .
Why do you come here ?
Rita .
Only to look for you .
What are you doing ?
Allmers .
Nothing .
Asta came down to me .
Rita .
Yes , but before Asta came ?
You have been away from me all the morning .
Allmers .
I have been sitting here looking out over the water .
Rita .
Ugh , -- how can you ?
Allmers . [ Impatiently .
] I like best to be alone now .
Rita . [ Moving restlessly about .
] And then to sit still !
To stay in one place !
Allmers .
I have nothing in the world to move for .
Rita .
I can_ _not bear to be anywhere long .
Least=of=all here -- with the fiord at my very feet .
Allmers .
It is just the nearness of the fiord --
Rita . [ To Borgheim .
] Do_ _n't you think he should come back with the rest of us ?
Borgheim . [ To Allmers .
] I believe it would be better for you .
Allmers .
No , no ; let me stay where I am .
Rita .
Then I will stay with you , Alfred .
Allmers .
Very well ; do so , then .
You remain too , Asta .
ASTA . [ Whispers to Borgheim . ] Let us leave them alone !
] Miss=Allmers , shall we go a little further -- along the shore ? For the very last time ?
ASTA . [ Taking her umbrella .
] Yes , come .
Let us go a=little further .
Allmers wanders about for a little .
Then he seats himself on a stone under the trees on the left .
]
] Can you think the thought , Alfred -- that we have lost Eyolf ?
] We must accustom ourselves to think it .
Rita .
I can_ _not .
I can_ _not .
And then that horrible sight that will haunt me all my life-long .
Allmers . [ Looking up .
] What sight ?
What have you seen ?
Rita .
I have seen nothing myself .
I have only heard it told .
Oh -- !
Allmers .
You may as=well tell me at=once .
Rita .
I got Borgheim to go down with me to the pier --
Allmers .
What did you want there ?
Rita .
To question the boys as=to how it happened .
Allmers .
But we know that .
Rita .
We got to know more .
Allmers .
Well ?
Rita .
It is not true that he disappeared all=at=once .
Allmers .
Do they say that now ?
Rita .
Yes .
They say they saw him lying down on the bottom .
Deep down in the clear water .
Allmers . [ Grinding his teeth .
] And they did_ _n't save him !
Rita .
I suppose they could not .
Allmers .
They could swim -- every one of them .
Did they tell you how he was lying whilst they could see him ?
Rita .
Yes .
They said he was lying on his back .
And with great , open eyes .
Allmers .
Open eyes .
But quite still ?
Rita .
Yes , quite still .
And then something came and swept him away .
They called it the undertow .
Allmers . [ Nodding slowly .
] So=that was the last they saw of him .
Rita . [ Suffocated with tears .
] Yes .
Allmers . [ In a dull voice .
] And never -- never will any one see him again .
Rita . [ Wailing .
] I shall see him day and night , as he lay down there .
Allmers .
With great , open eyes .
Rita . [ Shuddering .
] Yes , with great , open eyes .
I see them !
I see them now !
] Were they evil , those eyes , Rita ?
Rita . [ Turning pale .
] Evil -- !
Allmers . [ Going close up=to her .
] Were they evil eyes that stared up ?
Up from the depths ?
Rita . [ Shrinking from him .
] Alfred -- !
Allmers . [ Following her .
] Answer me !
Were they a child's evil eyes ?
Rita . [ Shrieks .
] Alfred !
Alfred !
Allmers .
Now things have come about -- just as you wished , Rita .
Rita .
I !
What did I wish ?
Allmers .
That Eyolf were not here .
Rita .
Never for a moment have I wished that !
That=Eyolf should not stand between us -- that was what I wished .
Allmers .
Well , well -- he does not stand between us any=more .
] Perhaps now more=than ever . [ With a sudden shudder .
] Oh , that horrible sight !
Allmers . [ Nods .
] The child's evil eyes .
] Let me be , Alfred !
I am afraid of you .
I have never seen you like this before .
] Sorrow makes us wicked and hateful .
] That is what I feel , too .
[ Allmers goes towards the right and looks out over the fiord .
Rita seats herself at the table .
A short pause .
]
] You never really and truly loved him -- never !
Rita . [ With cold self-control .
] Eyolf would never let me take him really and truly to my heart .
Allmers .
Because you did not want to .
Rita .
Oh yes , I did .
I did want to .
But some one stood in the way -- even from the first .
Allmers . [ Turning right round .
] Do you mean that _I_ stood in the way ?
Rita .
Oh , no -- not at=first .
Allmers . [ Coming nearer her .
] Who , then ?
Rita .
His aunt .
Allmers .
Asta ?
Rita . Yes . Asta stood and barred the way for me . Allmers . Can you say that , Rita ? Rita .
Yes .
Asta -- she took him to her heart -- from the moment that happened -- that miserable fall .
Allmers .
If she did so , she did it in=love .
Rita . [ Vehemently .
] That is just it !
I can_ _not endure to share anything with any one !
Not in=love .
Allmers .
We two should have shared him between us in=love .
Rita . [ Looking scornfully at him .
] We ?
Oh , the truth is you have never had any real love for him either .
] _I_ have not -- !
Rita .
No , you have not .
At=first you were so utterly taken up by that book of yours -- about Responsibility .
Allmers . [ Forcibly .
] Yes , I was .
But my very book -- I sacrificed for Eyolf's sake .
Rita .
Not out=of love for him .
Allmers .
Why then , do you suppose ?
Rita .
Because you were consumed with mistrust of yourself .
Because you had begun to doubt whether you had any great vocation to live for in the world .
Allmers . [ Observing her closely .
] Could you see that in me ?
Rita .
Oh , yes -- little=by=little .
And then you needed something new to fill up your life .
-- It seems _I_ was not enough for you any longer .
Allmers .
That is the law of change , Rita .
Rita .
And that was why you wanted to make a prodigy of poor little Eyolf .
Allmers .
That was not what I wanted .
I wanted to make a happy human being of him .
-- That , and nothing more .
Rita .
But not out=of love for him .
Look into yourself ! [ With a certain shyness of expression .
] Search out all that lies under -- and behind your action .
Allmers . [ Avoiding her eyes .
] There is something you shrink from saying .
Rita .
And you too .
Allmers . [ Looks thoughtfully at her .
] If it is as you say , then we two have never really possessed our own child .
Rita .
No. Not in perfect love .
Allmers .
And yet we are sorrowing so bitterly for him .
Rita . [ With sarcasm .
] Yes , is_ _n't it curious that we should grieve like this over a little stranger boy ?
Allmers . [ With an outburst .
] Oh , do_ _n't call him a stranger !
Rita . [ Sadly shaking her head .
] We never won the boy , Alfred .
Not I -- nor you either .
Allmers . [ Wringing his hands .
] And now it is too late !
Too late !
Rita .
And no consolation anywhere -- in anything .
Allmers . [ With sudden passion .
] You are the guilty one in this !
Rita . [ Rising .
] I !
Allmers .
Yes , you !
It was your fault that he became -- what he was !
It was your fault that he could not save himself when he fell into the water .
] Alfred -- you shall not throw the blame upon me !
Allmers . [ More=and=more beside himself .
] Yes , yes , I do !
It was you that left the helpless child unwatched upon the table .
Rita .
He was lying so comfortably among the cushions , and sleeping so soundly .
And you had promised to look after him .
Allmers .
Yes , I had . [ Lowering his voice .
] But then you came -- you , you , you -- and lured me to you .
Rita . [ Looking defiantly at him .
] Oh , better own at=once that you forgot the child and everything=else .
Allmers . [ In suppressed desperation .
] Yes , that is true . [ Lower .
] I forgot the child -- in your arms !
Rita . [ Exasperated .
] Alfred !
Alfred -- this is intolerable of you !
] In that hour you condemned little Eyolf to death .
Rita . [ Wildly .
] You , too !
You , too -- if it is as you say !
Allmers .
Oh yes -- call me to account , too -- if you will .
We have sinned , both of us .
And so , after all , there was retribution in Eyolf's death .
Rita .
Retribution ?
Allmers . [ With more self-control .
] Yes .
Judgment upon you and me .
Now , as we stand here , we have our deserts .
While he lived , we let ourselves shrink away from him in secret , abject remorse .
We could not bear to see it -- the thing he had to drag with him --
Rita . [ Whispers .
] The crutch .
Allmers .
Yes , that .
And now , what we now call sorrow and heartache -- is really the gnawing of conscience , Rita .
Nothing=else .
Rita . [ Gazing helplessly at him .
] I feel as=if all this must end in despair -- in madness for both of us .
For we can never -- never make it good again .
] I dreamed about Eyolf last night .
I thought I saw him coming up from the pier .
He could run like other boys .
So nothing had happened to him -- neither the one thing nor the other .
And the torturing reality was nothing but a dream , I thought .
Oh , how I thanked and blessed -- [ Checking himself . ] H'm !
Rita . [ Looking at him .
] Whom ?
Allmers . [ Evasively .
] Whom -- ?
Rita .
Yes ;
whom did you thank and bless ?
Allmers . [ Putting aside the question .
] I was only dreaming , you know --
Rita .
One whom you yourself do not believe in ?
Allmers .
That was how I felt , all=the=same .
Of=course , I was sleeping --
Rita . [ Reproachfully .
] You should not have taught me to doubt , Alfred .
Allmers .
Would it leave been right of me to let you go through life with your mind full of empty fictions ?
Rita .
It would have been better for me ;
for then I should have had something to take refuge in .
Now I am utterly at-sea .
Allmers . [ Observing her closely .
] If you had the choice now -- .
If you could follow Eyolf to where he is -- ?
Rita .
Yes ?
What then ?
Allmers .
If you were fully assured that you would find him again -- know him -- understand him -- ?
Rita .
Yes , yes ;
what then ?
Allmers .
Would you , of your own free will , take the leap over to him ?
Of your own free will leave everything behind you ?
Renounce your whole earthly life ?
Would you , Rita ?
Rita . [ Softly .
] Now , at=once ?
Allmers .
Yes ;
to-day .
This very hour .
Answer me -- would you ?
Rita . [ Hesitating .
] Oh , I do_ _n't know , Alfred .
No !
I think I should have to stay here with you , a little while .
Allmers .
For my sake ?
Rita .
Yes .
Only for your sake .
Allmers .
And afterwards ?
Would you then -- ?
Answer ! Rita .
Oh , what can I answer ?
I could not go away from you .
Never !
Never !
Allmers .
But suppose now _I_ went to Eyolf ?
And you had the fullest assurance that you would meet both him and me there .
Then would you come over to us ?
Rita .
I should want to -- so much !
so much !
But --
Allmers .
Well ?
I I ? Rita . [ Moaning softly .
] I could not -- I feel it .
No , no , I never could !
Not for all the glory of heaven !
Allmers .
Nor I .
Rita .
No , you feel it so , too , do_ _n't you , Alfred !
You could not either , could you ?
Allmers .
No. For it is here , in the life of earth , that we living beings are at-home .
Rita .
Yes , here lies the kind of happiness that we can understand .
Allmers . [ Darkly .
] Oh , happiness -- happiness --
Rita .
You mean that happiness -- that we can never find it again ? [ Looks inquiringly at him .
] But if -- ? [ Vehemently .
] No , no ;
I dare not say it !
Nor even think it !
Allmers .
Yes , say it -- say it , Rita .
Rita . [ Hesitatingly .
] Could we not try to -- ?
Would it not be possible to forget him ?
Allmers .
Forget Eyolf ?
Rita .
Forget the anguish and remorse , I mean .
Allmers .
Can you wish it ?
Rita .
Yes , -- if it were possible . [ With an outburst .
] For this -- I can_ _not bear this for=ever !
Oh , can we not think of something that will bring its forgetfulness !
Allmers . [ Shakes his head .
] What could that be ?
Rita .
Could we not see what travelling would do -- far away from here ?
Allmers .
From home ?
When you know you are never really well anywhere but here .
Rita .
Well , then , let us have crowds of people about us !
Keep open house !
Plunge into something that can deaden and dull our thoughts !
Allmers .
Such it life would be impossible for me .
-- No , -- rather=than that , I would try to take up my work again .
Rita . [ Bitingly .
] Your work -- the work that has always stood like a dead wall between us !
] There must always be a dead wall between us two , from this time forth .
Rita .
Why must there -- ?
Allmers .
Who knows but that a child's great , open eyes are watching us day and night .
Rita . [ Softly , shuddering .
] Alfred -- how terrible to think of !
Allmers .
Our love has been like a consuming fire .
Now it must be quenched --
] Quenched !
Allmers . [ Hardly .
] It is quenched -- in one of us .
Rita . [ As=if petrified .
] And you dare say that to me !
Allmers . [ More gently .
] It is dead , Rita .
But in what I now feel for you -- in our common guilt and need of atonement -- I seem to foresee a sort of resurrection --
Rita . [ Vehemently .
] I do_ _n't care a=bit about any resurrection !
Allmers .
Rita !
Rita .
I am a warm-blooded being !
I do_ _n't go drowsing about -- with fishes' blood in my veins . [ Wringing her hands .
] And now to be imprisoned for life -- in anguish and remorse !
Imprisoned with one who is no=longer mine , mine , mine !
Allmers .
It must have ended so , sometime , Rita .
Rita .
Must have ended so !
The love that in the beginning rushed forth so eagerly to meet with love !
Allmers .
My love did not rush forth to you in the beginning .
Rita .
What did you feel for me , first=of=all ?
Allmers .
Dread .
Rita .
That I can understand .
How was it , then , that I won you after all ?
Allmers . [ In a low voice .
] You were so entrancingly beautiful , Rita .
Rita . [ Looks searchingly at him .
] Then that was the only reason ?
Say it , Alfred !
The only reason ?
Allmers . [ Conquering himself .
] No , there was another as=well .
Rita . [ With an outburst .
] I can guess what that was !
It was " my gold , and my green forests , " as you call it .
Was it not so , Alfred ?
Allmers .
Yes .
] How could you -- how could you !
Allmers .
I had Asta to think of .
Rita . [ Angrily .
] Yes , Asta ! [ Bitterly .
] Then it was really Asta that brought us two together ?
Allmers .
She knew nothing about it .
She has no suspicion of it , even to this day .
Rita . [ Rejecting the plea .
] It was Asta , nevertheless ! [ Smiling , with a sidelong glance of scorn .
] Or , no -- it was little Eyolf .
Little Eyolf , my dear !
Allmers .
Eyolf -- ?
Rita .
Yes , you used to call her Eyolf , did you not ?
I seem to remember your telling me so -- once , in a moment of confidence . [ Coming up=to him .
] Do you remember it -- that entrancingly beautiful hour , Alfred ?
] I remember nothing !
I will not remember !
Rita . [ Following him .
] It was in that hour -- when your other little Eyolf was crippled for life !
] Retribution !
Rita . [ Menacingly .
] Yes , retribution !
[ ASTA and Borgheim return by way of the boat-shed .
She is carrying some water-lilies in her hand .
]
Rita . [ With self-control .
] Well , Asta , have you and Mr.=Borgheim talked things thoroughly over ?
ASTA .
Oh , yes -- pretty well .
[ She puts down her umbrella and lays the flowers upon a chair .
]
Borgheim .
Miss=Allmers has been very silent during our walk .
Rita .
Indeed , has she ?
ASTA . [ Looking eagerly at both of them . ] What is this -- ?
Rita .
Enough to last all our lifetime , I say . [ Breaking off .
] Come now , let us go up=to the house , all four of us .
We must have company about us in future .
It will never do for Alfred and me to be alone .
Allmers .
Yes , do you go-ahead , you two . [ Turning .
] I must speak a word to you before we go , Asta .
Rita . [ Looking at him .
] Indeed ?
Well then , you come with me , Mr. Borgheim .
[ Rita and Borgheim go up the wood-path .
]
ASTA . [ Anxiously .
] Alfred , what is the matter ?
Allmers . [ Darkly .
] Only that I can_ _not endure to be here any=more .
ASTA .
Here !
With=Rita , do you mean ?
Allmers .
Yes .
Rita and I can_ _not go on living together .
] Oh , Alfred -- do_ _n't say anything so terrible !
Allmers .
It is the truth . I am telling you .
We are making each=other wicked and hateful .
ASTA . [ With painful emotion .
] I had never -- never dreamt of anything like this !
Allmers .
I did not realise it either , till to-day .
ASTA .
And now you want to -- !
What is it you really want , Alfred ?
Allmers .
I want to get away from everything here -- far , far away from it all .
ASTA .
And to stand quite alone in the world ?
Allmers . [ Nods .
] As=I used to , before , yes .
ASTA .
But you are not fitted for living alone !
Allmers .
Oh , yes .
I was so in the old days , at=any=rate .
ASTA .
In the old days , yes ;
for then you had me with you .
] Yes .
And it is to you , Asta , that I now want to come home again .
ASTA . [ Eluding him .
] To me !
No , no , Alfred !
That is quite impossible .
Allmers . [ Looks sadly at her .
] Then=Borgheim stands in the way after all ?
ASTA . [ Earnestly .
] No , no ;
he does not !
That is quite a mistake !
Allmers .
Good .
Then I will come to you -- my dear , dear sister .
I must come to you again -- home to you , to be purified and ennobled after my life with --
ASTA . [ Shocked .
] Alfred , -- you are doing Rita a great wrong !
Allmers .
I have done her a great wrong .
But not in this .
Oh , think of it , Asta -- think of our life together , yours and mine .
Was it not like one long holy-day from first to last ?
ASTA .
Yes , it was , Alfred .
But we can never live it over again .
Allmers . [ Bitterly .
] Do you mean that marriage has so irreparably ruined me ?
ASTA . [ Quietly .
] No , that is not what I mean .
Allmers .
Well , then we two will live our old life over again .
ASTA . [ With decision .
] We can_ _not , Alfred .
Allmers .
Yes , we can .
For the love of a brother and sister --
ASTA . [ Eagerly .
] What of it ?
Allmers .
That is the only relation in life that is not subject to the law of change .
ASTA . [ Softly and tremblingly .
] But if that relation were not --
Allmers .
Not -- ?
ASTA .
-- not our relation ?
] Not ours ?
Why , what can you mean by that ?
ASTA .
It is best I should tell you at=once , Alfred .
Allmers .
Yes , yes ; tell me !
ASTA .
The letters to mother -- .
Those in my portfolio --
Allmers .
Well ?
ASTA .
You must read them -- when I am gone .
Allmers .
Why must I ?
ASTA . [ Struggling with herself .
] For then you will see that --
Allmers .
Well ?
ASTA .
-- that I have no right to bear your father's name .
Allmers . [ Staggering backwards .
] Asta !
What is this you say !
ASTA .
Read the letters .
Then you will see -- and understand .
And perhaps have some forgiveness -- for mother , too .
Allmers . [ Clutching at his forehead .
] I can_ _not grasp this -- I can_ _not realise the thought .
You , Asta -- you are not --
ASTA .
You are not my brother , Alfred .
] Well , but what difference does that really make in our relation ?
Practically none at all .
ASTA . [ Shaking her head . ] It makes all the difference , Alfred .
Our relation is not that of brother and sister .
Allmers .
No , no. But it is none=the=less sacred for that -- it will always be equally sacred .
ASTA .
Do not forget -- that it is subject to the law of change , as you said just now .
Allmers . [ Looks inquiringly at her .
] Do you mean that --
] Not a word more -- my dear , dear Alfred . [ Takes up the flowers from the chair .
] Do you see these water-lilies ?
Allmers . [ Nodding slowly .
] They are the sort that shoot up -- from the very depth .
ASTA .
I pulled them in the tarn -- where it flows out into the fiord . [ Holds them out to him .
] Will you take them , Alfred ? Allmers . [ Taking them .
] Thanks .
ASTA . [ With tears in her eyes .
] They are a last greeting to you , from -- from little Eyolf . Allmers . [ Looking at her .
] From=Eyolf out yonder ?
Or from you ?
ASTA . [ Softly .
] From both of us . [ Taking up her umbrella .
] Now come with me to Rita .
[ She goes up the wood-path .
]
Allmers . [ Takes up his hat from the table , and whispers sadly . ] Asta .
Eyolf .
Little Eyolf -- !
[ He follows her up the path .
]
Act Third
[ An elevation , overgrown with shrubs , in Allmers's garden .
At the back a sheer cliff , with a railing along its edge , and with steps on the left leading downwards .
An extensive view over the fiord , which lies deep below .
A flagstaff with lines , but no flag , stands by the railing .
In front , on the right , a summer-house , covered with creepers and wild vines .
Outside it , a bench .
It is a late summer evening , with clear sky .
Deepening twilight .
]
[ ASTA is sitting on the bench , with her hands in her lap .
She is wearing her outdoor dress and a hat , has her parasol at her side , and a little travelling-bag on a strap over her shoulder .
]
[ Borgheim comes up from the back on the left .
He , too , has a travelling-bag over his shoulder .
He is carrying a rolled-up flag .
]
Borgheim . [ Catching sight of ASTA .
] Oh , so you are up here !
ASTA .
Yes , I am taking my last look out over the fiord .
Borgheim .
Then I am glad I happened to come up .
ASTA .
Have you been searching for me ?
Borgheim .
Yes , I have .
I wanted to say good-bye to you for the present .
Not for good and all , I hope .
ASTA . [ With a faint smile .
] You are persevering .
Borgheim .
A road-maker has got to be .
ASTA .
Have you seen anything of Alfred ?
Or=of=Rita ?
Borgheim .
Yes , I saw them both .
ASTA .
Together ?
Borgheim .
No -- apart .
ASTA .
What are you going to do with that flag ?
Borgheim .
Mrs.=Allmers asked me to come up and hoist it .
ASTA .
Hoist a flag just now ?
Borgheim .
Half-mast high .
She wants it to fly both night and day , she says .
ASTA . [ Sighing .
] Poor=Rita !
And poor Alfred !
Borgheim . [ Busied with the flag .
] Have you the heart to leave them ?
I ask , because I see you are in travelling-dress .
ASTA . [ In a low voice .
] I must go .
Borgheim .
Well , if you must , then --
ASTA .
And you are going , too , to-night ?
Borgheim .
I must , too .
I am going by the train .
Are you going that way ?
ASTA .
No. I shall take the steamer .
Borgheim . [ Glancing at her .
] We each take our own way , then ?
ASTA .
Yes .
[ She sits and looks on while he hoists the flag half-mast high .
When he has done he goes up=to her .
]
Borgheim .
Miss=Asta -- you can_ _n't think how grieved I am about little Eyolf .
ASTA . [ Looks up at him .
] Yes , I am sure you feel it deeply .
Borgheim .
And the feeling tortures me .
For the fact is , grief is not much in my way .
] It will pass over in time -- all of it .
All our sorrow .
Borgheim .
All ?
Do you believe that ?
ASTA .
Like a squall at-sea .
When once you have got far away from here , then --
Borgheim .
It will have to be very far away indeed .
ASTA .
And then you have this great new road-work , too .
Borgheim .
But no=one to help me in it .
ASTA .
Oh yes , surely you have .
Borgheim . [ Shaking his head .
] No=one .
No=one to share the gladness with .
For it is gladness that most needs sharing .
ASTA .
Not the labour and trouble ?
Borgheim .
Pooh -- that sort of thing one can always get through alone .
ASTA .
But the gladness -- that must be shared with some one , you think ?
Borgheim .
Yes ; for if=not , where would be the pleasure in being glad ?
ASTA .
Ah yes -- perhaps there is something in that .
Borgheim .
Oh , of=course , for a certain time you can go on feeling glad in your own heart .
But it will_ _n't do in the long-run .
No , it takes two to be glad .
ASTA .
Always two ?
Never more ?
Never many ?
Borgheim .
Well , you see -- then it becomes a quite different matter .
Miss Asta -- are you sure you can never make up your mind to share gladness and success and -- and labour and trouble , with one -- with one alone in all the world ?
ASTA .
I have tried it -- once .
Borgheim .
Have you ?
ASTA .
Yes , all=the=time that my brother -- that Alfred and I lived together .
Borgheim .
Oh , with your brother , yes .
But that is altogether different .
That ought rather to be called peace than happiness , I should say .
ASTA .
It was delightful , all=the=same .
Borgheim .
There now -- you see even that seemed to you delightful .
But just think now -- if he had not been your brother !
] Then we should never have been together .
For I was a child then -- and he was_ _n't much more .
Borgheim . [ After a pause .
] Was it so delightful -- that time ?
ASTA .
Oh yes , indeed it was .
Borgheim .
Was there much that was really bright and happy in your life then ?
ASTA .
Oh yes , so much .
You can_ _not think how much .
Borgheim .
Tell me a little about it , Miss=Asta .
ASTA .
Oh , there are only trifles to tell .
Borgheim .
Such=as -- ?
Well ?
ASTA .
Such=as the time when Alfred had passed his examination -- and had distinguished himself .
And then , from time , to time , when he got a post in some school or other .
Or when he would sit at-home working at an article -- and would read it aloud to me .
And then when it would appear in some magazine .
Borgheim .
Yes , I can quite see that it must have been a peaceful , delightful life -- a brother and sister sharing all their joys . [ Shaking his head .
] What=I can_ _not understand is that your brother could ever give you up , Asta .
ASTA . [ With suppressed emotion .
] Alfred married , you know .
Borgheim .
Was not that very hard for you ?
ASTA .
Yes , at=first .
It seemed as=though I had utterly lost him all at once .
Borgheim .
Well , luckily it was not so bad as that .
ASTA .
No.
Borgheim .
But , all=the=same -- how could he !
Go and marry , I mean -- when he could have kept you with him , alone !
] He was subject to the law of change , I suppose .
Borgheim .
The law of change ?
ASTA .
So Alfred calls it .
Borgheim .
Pooh -- what a stupid law that must be !
I do_ _n't believe a=bit in that law .
ASTA . [ Rising .
] You may come to believe in it , in time .
Borgheim .
Never in all my life ! [ Insistently .
] But listen now , Miss Asta !
Do be reasonable for once in a way -- in this matter , I mean --
ASTA . [ Interrupting him .
] Oh , no , no -- do_ _n't let us begin upon that again !
Borgheim . [ Continuing as before .
] Yes , Asta -- I can_ _n't possibly give you up so easily .
Now your brother has everything as he wishes it .
He can live his life quite contentedly without you .
He does_ _n't require you at all .
Then this -- this -- that at one blow has changed your whole position here --
ASTA . [ With a start .
] What do you mean by that ?
Borgheim .
The loss of the child .
What else should I mean ?
ASTA . [ Recovering her self-control . ] Little=Eyolf is gone , yes .
Borgheim .
And what more does that leave you to do here ?
You have not the poor little boy to take care of now .
You have no duties -- no claims upon you of any sort .
ASTA .
Oh , please , Mr.=Borgheim -- do_ _n't make it so hard for me .
Borgheim .
I must ;
I should be mad if I did not try my uttermost .
I shall be leaving town before very long , rind perhaps I shall have no opportunity of meeting you there .
Perhaps I shall not see you again for a long , long-time .
And who knows what may happen in the meanwhile ?
ASTA . [ With a grave smile .
] So you are afraid of the law of change , after all ?
Borgheim .
No , not in the least . [ Laughing bitterly .
] And there is nothing to be changed , either -- not in you .
I mean .
For I can see you do_ _n't care much about me .
ASTA .
You know very well that I do .
Borgheim .
Perhaps , but not nearly enough .
Not as I want you to . [ More forcibly .
] By=Heaven , Asta -- Miss=Asta -- I can_ _not tell you how strongly I feel that you are wrong in this !
A little onward , perhaps , from to-day and to-morrow , all life's happiness may be awaiting us .
And we must needs pass it by !
Do you think we will not come to repent of it , Asta ?
ASTA . [ Quietly .
] I do_ _n't know .
I only know that they are not for us -- all these bright possibilities .
] Then=I must make my roads alone ?
ASTA . [ Warmly .
] Oh , how I wish I could stand by you in it all !
Help you in the labour -- share the gladness with you --
Borgheim .
Would you -- if you could ?
ASTA .
Yes , that I would .
Borgheim .
But you can_ _not ?
ASTA . [ Looking down . ] Would you be content to have only half of me ?
Borgheim .
No. You must be utterly and entirely mine .
] Then=I can_ _not .
Borgheim .
Good-bye then , Miss=Asta .
[ He is on the point of going .
Allmers comes up from the left at the back .
Borgheim stops .
] Is=Rita in=there -- in the summer-house ?
Borgheim .
No ;
there is no=one here but Miss=Asta .
[ Allmers comes forward .
]
ASTA . [ Going towards him . ] Shall=I go down and look for her ?
Shall I get her to come up here ?
Allmers . [ With a negative gesture .
] No , no , no -- let it alone . [ To Borgheim .
] Is it you that have hoisted the flag ?
Borgheim .
Yes .
Mrs.=Allmers asked me to .
That was what brought me up here .
Allmers .
And you are going to start to-night ?
Borgheim .
Yes .
To-night I go away in good earnest .
] And you have made sure of pleasant company , I daresay .
Borgheim . [ Shaking his head .
] I am going alone .
Allmers . [ With surprise .
] Alone !
Borgheim .
Utterly alone .
Allmers . [ Absently .
] Indeed ?
Borgheim .
And I shall have to remain alone , too .
Allmers .
There is something horrible in being alone .
The thought of it runs like ice through my blood --
ASTA .
Oh , but , Alfred , you are not alone .
Allmers .
There may be something horrible in that too , Asta .
ASTA . [ Oppressed .
] Oh , do_ _n't talk like that !
Do_ _n't think like that !
Allmers . [ Not listening to her .
] But since you are not going with him -- ?
Since there is nothing to bind you -- ? Why will you not remain out here with me -- and with Rita ?
ASTA . [ Uneasily .
] No , no , I can_ _not .
I must go back to town now .
Allmers .
But only in to town , Asta .
Do you hear !
ASTA .
Yes .
Allmers .
And you must promise me that you will soon come out again .
ASTA . [ Quickly .
] No , no , I dare not promise you that , for the present .
Allmers .
Well as you will .
We shall soon meet in-town , then .
ASTA . [ Imploringly .
] But , Alfred , you must stay at home here with Rita now .
] You may find it a good thing , after all , that you have to take your journey alone .
Borgheim . [ Annoyed .
] Oh , how can you say such a thing ?
Allmers .
You see , you can never tell whom you might happen to meet afterwards -- on the way .
ASTA . [ Involuntarily .
] Alfred !
Allmers .
The right fellow-traveller -- when it is too late -- too late .
ASTA . [ Softly , quivering .
] Alfred !
Alfred !
] What is the meaning of this ?
I do_ _n't understand --
[ Rita comes up from the left at the back .
]
Rita . [ Plaintively .
] Oh , do_ _n't go away from me , all of you !
ASTA . [ Going towards her .
] You said you preferred to be alone .
Rita .
Yes , but I dare not .
It is getting so horribly dark .
I seem to see great , open eyes fixed upon me !
ASTA . [ Tenderly and sympathetically .
] What if it were so , Rita ?
You ought not to be afraid of those eyes .
Rita .
How can you say so !
Not afraid !
Allmers . [ Insistently .
] Asta , I beg you -- for Heaven's sake -- remain here with Rita !
Rita .
Yes !
And with Alfred , too .
Do !
Do , Asta !
ASTA . [ Struggling with herself .
] Oh , I want to so much --
Rita .
Well , then , do it !
For=Alfred and I can_ _not go alone through the sorrow and heartache .
Allmers . [ Darkly .
] Say , rather -- through the ranklings of remorse .
Rita .
Oh , whatever you like to call it -- we can_ _not bear it alone , we two .
Oh , Asta , I beg and implore you !
Stay here and help us !
Take=Eyolf's place for us --
ASTA . [ Shrinking .
] Eyolf's --
Rita .
Yes , would you not have it so , Alfred ?
Allmers .
If she can and will .
Rita .
You used to call her your little Eyolf . [ Seizes her hand .
] Henceforth you shall be our Eyolf , Asta !
Eyolf , as you were before .
Allmers . [ With concealed emotion .
] Remain -- and share our life with us , Asta .
With Rita .
With me .
With me -- your brother !
ASTA . [ With decision , snatches her hand away .
] No. I can_ _not . [ Turning .
] Mr.=Borgheim -- what time does the steamer start ?
Borgheim .
Now -- at=once .
ASTA .
Then I must go on-board .
Will you go with me ?
] Will=I ?
Yes , yes !
ASTA .
Then come !
Rita . [ Slowly .
] Ah ! That is how it is .
ASTA . [ Throwing her arms round her neck .
] Thanks for everything , Rita ! ( Goes up=to Allmers and grasps his hand .
) Alfred-good-bye ! A thousand times , good-bye !
Allmers . [ Softly and eagerly .
] What is this , Asta ? It seems as=though you were taking flight .
ASTA . [ In subdued anguish .
] Yes , Alfred -- I am taking flight .
Allmers .
Flight -- from me !
ASTA . [ Whispering .
] From you -- and from myself .
Allmers . [ Shrinking back .
] Ah -- !
[ ASTA rushes down the steps at the back .
Borgheim waves his hat and follows her .
Rita leans against the entrance to the summer-house .
A pause .
] Allmers . [ Turns , and says with hard-won composure . ] There comes the steamer .
Look , Rita .
Rita .
I dare not look at it .
Allmers .
You dare not ?
Rita .
No. For it has a red eye -- and a green one , too .
Great , glowing eyes .
Allmers .
Oh , those are only the lights , you know .
Rita .
Henceforth they are eyes -- for me .
They stare and stare out=of the darkness -- and into the darkness .
Allmers .
Now she is putting in to shore .
Rita .
Where are they mooring her this evening , then ?
Allmers . [ Coming forward .
] At the pier , as=usual --
Rita . [ Drawing herself up .
] How can they moor her there !
Allmers .
They must .
Rita .
But it was there that Eyolf -- !
How can they moor her there !
Allmers .
Yes , life is pitiless , Rita .
Rita .
Men are heartless .
They take no thought -- whether for the living or for the dead .
Allmers .
There you are right .
Life goes its own way -- just as=if nothing in the world had happened .
Rita . [ Gazing straight before her .
] And nothing has happened , either .
Not to others .
Only to us two .
Allmers . [ The pain re-awakening .
] Yes , Rita -- so it was to no purpose that you bore him in sorrow and anguish .
For now he is gone again -- and has left no trace behind him .
Rita .
Only the crutch was saved .
Allmers . [ Angrily .
] Be silent !
Do not let me hear that word !
Rita . [ Plaintively .
] Oh , I can_ _not bear the thought that he is gone from us .
Allmers . [ Coldly and bitterly .
] You could very well do without him while he was with us .
Half the day would often pass without your setting eyes on him .
Rita .
Yes , for I knew that I could see him whenever I wanted to .
Allmers .
Yes , that is how we have gone and squandered the short time we had with Little=Eyolf .
Rita . [ Listening , in dread .
] Do you hear , Alfred !
Now it is ringing again !
Allmers . [ Looking over the fiord .
] It is the steamer's bell that is ringing .
She is just starting .
Rita .
Oh , it_ _s not that bell I mean .
All-day I have heard it ringing in my ears .
-- Now it is ringing again !
Allmers . [ Going up=to her .
] You are mistaken , Rita .
Rita .
No , I hear it so plainly .
It sounds like a knell .
Slow .
Slow .
And always the same words .
Allmers .
Words ?
What words ?
] " The crutch is -- floating .
The crutch is -- floating .
" Oh , surely you must hear it , too !
Allmers . [ Shaking his head .
] I hear nothing .
And there is nothing to hear .
Rita .
Oh , you may say what you will -- I hear it so plainly .
] Now they are on-board , Rita .
Now the steamer is on her way to the town .
Rita .
Is it possible you do not hear it ?
" The crutch is -- floating .
The crutch is ------ "
Allmers . [ Coming forward .
] You shall not stand there listening to a sound that does not exist .
I tell You , Asta and Borgheim are on-board .
They have started already .
Asta is gone .
Rita . [ Looks timidly at him .
] Then=I suppose you will soon be gone , too , Alfred ?
Allmers . [ Quickly .
] What do you mean by that ?
Rita .
That you will follow your sister .
Allmers .
Has Asta told you anything ?
Rita .
No. But you said yourself it was for Asta's sake that -- that we came together .
Allmers .
Yes , but you , you yourself , have bound me to you -- by our life together .
Rita .
Oh , in your eyes I am not -- I am not -- entrancingly beautiful any more .
Allmers .
The law of change may perhaps keep us together , none=the=less .
Rita . [ Nodding slowly .
] There is a change in me now -- I feel the anguish of it .
Allmers .
Anguish ?
Rita .
Yes , for change , too , is a sort of birth .
Allmers .
It is -- or a resurrection .
Transition to a higher life .
Rita . [ Gazing sadly before her .
] Yes -- with the loss of all , all life's happiness .
Allmers .
That loss is just the gain .
Rita . [ Vehemently .
] Oh , phrases !
Good=God , we are creatures of earth after all .
Allmers .
But something akin=to the sea and the heavens too , Rita .
Rita .
You perhaps .
Not I .
Allmers .
Oh , yes -- you too , more=than you yourself suspect .
] Tell me , Alfred -- could you think of taking up your work again ?
Allmers .
The work that you have hated so ?
Rita .
I am easier to please now .
I am willing to share you with the book .
Allmers .
Why ?
Rita .
Only to keep you here with me -- to have you near me .
Allmers .
Oh , it is so little I can do to help you , Rita .
Rita .
But perhaps I could help you .
Allmers .
With my book , do you mean ?
Rita .
No ;
but to live your life .
Allmers . [ Shaking his head .
] I seem to have no life to live .
Rita .
Well then , to endure your life .
] I think it would be best for both of us that we should part .
Rita . [ Looking curiously at him .
] Then where would you go ?
Perhaps to Asta , after all ?
Allmers .
No -- never=again to Asta .
Rita .
Where then ?
Allmers .
Up into the solitudes .
Rita .
Up among the mountains ?
Is that what you mean ?
Allmers .
Yes .
Rita .
But all that is mere dreaming , Alfred !
You could not live up there .
Allmers .
And yet I feel myself drawn to them .
Rita .
Why ?
Tell me !
Allmers .
Sit down -- and I will tell you something .
Rita .
Something that happened to you up there ?
Allmers .
Yes .
Rita .
And that you never told Asta and me ?
Allmers .
Yes .
Rita .
Oh , you are so silent about everything .
You ought not to be .
Allmers .
Sit down there -- and I will tell you about it .
Rita .
Yes , yes -- tell me !
[ She sits on the bench beside the summer-house .
]
Allmers .
I was alone up there , in the heart of the great mountains .
I came to a wide , dreary mountain lake ;
and that lake I had to cross .
But I could not -- for there was neither a boat nor any one there .
Rita .
Well ?
And then ?
Allmers .
Then I went without any guidance into a side valley .
I thought that by that way I could push on over the heights and between the peaks -- and then down again on the other side of the lake .
Rita .
Oh , and you lost yourself , Alfred !
Allmers .
Yes ;
I mistook the direction -- for there was no path or track .
And all-day I went on -- and all the next night .
And at=last I thought I should never see the face of man again .
Rita .
Not come home to us ?
Oh , then , I am sure your thoughts were with us here .
Allmers .
No -- they were not .
Rita .
Not ?
Allmers .
No. It was so strange .
Both you and Eyolf seemed to have drifted far , far away from me -- and Asta , too .
Rita .
Then what did you think of ?
Allmers .
I did not think .
I dragged myself along among the precipices -- and revelled in the peace and luxury of death .
Rita . [ Springing up .
] Oh , do_ _n't speak in that way of that horror !
Allmers .
I did not feel it so .
I had no fear .
Here went death and I , it seemed to me , like two good fellow-travellers .
It all seemed so natural -- so simple , I thought .
In my family , we do_ _n't live to be old --
Rita .
Oh , do_ _n't say such things , Alfred !
You see you came safely out=of it , after all .
Allmers .
Yes ;
all=of=a=sudden , I found myself where I wanted to be -- on the other side of the lake .
Rita .
It must have been a night of terror for you , Alfred .
But now that it is over , you will not admit it to yourself .
Allmers .
That night sealed my resolution .
And it was then that I turned about and came straight homewards .
To Eyolf .
Rita . [ Softly .
] Too late .
Allmers .
Yes .
And then when -- my fellow-traveller came and took him -- then I felt the horror of it ;
of it all ;
of all that , in=spite=of everything , we dare not tear ourselves away from .
So earthbound are we , both of us , Rita .
] Yes , you are , too , are you not ! [ Coming close to him .
] Oh , let us live our life together as=long=as we can !
Allmers . [ Shrugging his shoulders .
] Live our life , yes !
And have nothing to fill life with .
An empty void on=all=sides -- wherever I look .
Rita . [ In fear .
] Oh , sooner=or=later you will go away from me , Alfred !
I feel it !
I can see it in your face !
You will go away from me .
Allmers .
With my fellow-traveller , do you mean ?
Rita .
No , I mean worse than that .
Of your own free will -- you will leave me -- for you think it_ _s only here , with me , that you have nothing to live for .
Is not that what is in your thoughts ?
Allmers . [ Looking steadfastly at her .
] What if it were -- ?
[ A disturbance , and the noise of angry , quarrelling voices is heard from down below , in the distance .
Allmers goes to the railing .
]
Rita .
What is that ? [ With an outburst .
] Oh , you_ _ll see , they have found him !
Allmers .
He will never be found .
Rita .
But what is it then ?
Allmers . [ Coming forward .
] Only fighting -- as=usual .
Rita .
Down on the beach ?
Allmers .
Yes .
The whole village down there ought=to be swept away .
Now the men have come home -- drunk , as they always are .
They are beating the children -- do you hear the boys crying !
The women are shrieking for help for them --
Rita .
Should we not get some one to go down and help them ?
Allmers . [ Harshly and angrily .
] Help them , who did not help Eyolf !
Let them go -- as they let Eyolf go .
Rita .
Oh , you must not talk like that , Alfred !
Nor think like that !
Allmers .
I can_ _not think otherwise .
All the old hovels ought=to be torn down .
Rita .
And then what is to become of all the poor people ?
Allmers .
They must go somewhere else .
Rita .
And the children , too ?
Allmers .
Does it make much difference where they go to the dogs ?
Rita . [ Quietly and reproachfully .
] You are forcing yourself into this harshness , Alfred .
Allmers . [ Vehemently .
] I have a right to be harsh now !
It is my duty .
Rita .
Your duty ?
Allmers .
My duty to Eyolf .
He must not lie unavenged .
Once for all , Rita -- it is as I tell you !
Think it over !
Have the whole place down there razed to the ground -- when I am gone .
Rita . [ Looks intently at him .
] When you are gone ?
Allmers .
Yes . For that will at=least give you something to fill your life with -- and something you must have .
Rita . [ Firmly and decidedly .
] There you are right --- I must .
But can you guess what I will set about -- when you are gone ?
Allmers .
Well , what ?
Rita . [ Slowly and with resolution .
] As=soon=as you are gone from me , I will go down to the beach , and bring all the poor neglected children home with me .
All the mischievous boys --
Allmers .
What will you do with them here ?
Rita .
I will take them to my heart .
Allmers .
You !
Rita .
Yes , I will .
From the day you leave me , they shall all be here , all of them , as=if they were mine .
Allmers . [ Shocked .
] In our little Eyolf's place !
Rita .
Yes , in our little Eyolf's place .
They shall live in Eyolf's rooms .
They shall read his books .
They shall play with his toys .
They shall take it in turns to sit in his chair at table .
Allmers .
But this is sheer madness in you !
I do not know a creature in the world that is less fitted than you for anything of that sort .
Rita .
Then I shall have to educate myself for it ;
to train myself ;
to discipline myself .
Allmers .
If you are really in earnest about this -- about all you say -- then there must indeed be a change in you .
Rita .
Yes , there is , Alfred -- and for that I have you to thank .
You have made an empty place within me ;
and I must try to fill it up with something -- with something that is a=little like love .
Allmers . [ Stands for a moment lost in thought ;
then looks at her .
] The truth is , we have not done much for the poor people down there .
Rita .
We have done nothing for them .
Allmers .
Scarcely even thought of them .
Rita .
Never thought of them in sympathy .
Allmers .
We , who had « the gold , and the green forests » --
Rita .
Our hands were closed to them .
And our hearts too .
Allmers . [ Nods .
] Then it was perhaps natural enough , after all , that they should not risk their lives to save little Eyolf .
Rita . [ Softly .
] Think , Alfred !
Are you so certain that -- that we would have risked ours ?
] You must never doubt that .
Rita .
Oh , we are children of earth .
Allmers .
What do you really think you can do with all these neglected children ?
Rita .
I suppose I must try if I can_ _not lighten and -- and ennoble their lot in life .
Allmers .
If you can do that -- then Eyolf was not born in vain .
Rita .
Nor taken from us in vain , either .
Allmers . [ Looking steadfastly at her .
] Be quite clear about one thing , Rita -- it is not love that is driving you to this .
Rita .
No , it is not -- at=any=rate , not=yet .
Allmers .
Well , then what is it ?
Rita . [ Half-evasively .
] You have so-often talked to Asta of human responsibility --
Allmers .
Of the book that you hated .
Rita .
I hate that book still .
But I used to sit and listen to what you told her .
And now I will try to continue it -- in my own way .
Allmers . [ Shaking his head .
] It is not for=the=sake=of that unfinished book --
Rita .
No , I have another reason as=well .
Allmers .
What is that ?
] I want to make my peace with the great , open eyes , you see .
] Perhaps , I could join you in that ?
And help you , Rita ?
Rita .
Would you ?
Allmers .
Yes -- if I were only sure I could .
Rita . [ Hesitatingly .
] But then you would have to remain here .
Allmers . [ Softly .
] Let us try if it could not be so .
Rita . [ Almost inaudibly .
] Yes , let us , Alfred .
[ Both are silent .
Then Allmers goes up=to the flagstaff and hoists the flag to the top .
Rita stands beside the summer-house and looks at him in silence .
]
Allmers . [ Coming forward again .
] We have a heavy day of work before us , Rita .
Rita .
You will see -- that now=and=then a Sabbath peace will descend on us .
Allmers . [ Quietly , with emotion .
] Then , perhaps , we shall know that the spirits are with us .
Rita . [ Whispering .
] The spirits ?
Allmers . [ As before .
] Yes , they will perhaps be around us -- those whom we have lost .
Rita . [ Nods slowly .
] Our little Eyolf .
And your big Eyolf , too .
Allmers . [ Gazing straight before him .
] Now=and=then , perhaps , we may still -- on the way through life -- have a little , passing glimpse of them .
Rita .
When , shall we look for them , Alfred ?
] Upwards .
Rita . [ Nods in approval .
] Yes , yes -- upwards .
Allmers .
Upwards -- towards the peaks .
Towards the stars .
And towards the great silence .
Rita . [ Giving him her hand .
] Thanks !
