« She Stoops To Conquer »
Is there a creature in the whole country but ourselves , that does not take a trip to town now=and=then , to rub off the rust a little ?
There's the two Miss=Hoggs , and our neighbour Mrs.=Grigsby , go to take a month's polishing every winter .
Hardcastle .
Ay , and bring back vanity and affectation to last them the whole-year .
I wonder why London can_ _not keep its own fools at-home !
Its fopperies come down not only as inside passengers , but in the very basket . Mrs .
Hardcastle . Ay , your times were fine times indeed ; you have been telling us of them for many a long year .
Here we live in an old rumbling mansion , that looks for all the world like an inn , but that we never see company .
Our best visitors are old Mrs.=Oddfish , the curate's wife , and little Cripplegate , the lame dancing-master ; and all our entertainment your old stories of Prince=Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough .
I hate such old-fashioned trumpery .
Hardcastle . And I love it .
I love everything that_ _s old : old friends , old times , old manners , old books , old wine ;
and I believe , Dorothy ( taking her hand ) , you_ _ll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Lord , Mr.=Hardcastle , you_ _re for=ever at your Dorothys and your old wifes .
You may be a Darby , but I_ _ll be no Joan , I promise you .
I_ _m not so old as you_ _d make me , by more=than one good year .
Add twenty=to=twenty , and make money of that .
Hardcastle . Let me see ;
twenty added to twenty makes just fifty and seven . Mrs .
Hardcastle . It_ _s false , Mr.=Hardcastle ;
I was but twenty when I was brought to bed of Tony , that I had by Mr.=Lumpkin , my first husband ;
and he_ _s not come to years of discretion yet .
Hardcastle .
Nor ever will , I dare answer for him .
Ay , you have taught him finely . Mrs . Hardcastle .
No=matter . Tony=Lumpkin has a good fortune .
My son is not to live by his learning .
I do_ _n't think a boy wants much learning to spend fifteen hundred a year .
Hardcastle .
Learning , quotha !
a mere composition of tricks and mischief .
Mrs .
Hardcastle . Humour , my dear ;
nothing but humour .
Come , Mr. Hardcastle , you must allow the boy a little humour .
Hardcastle . I_ _d sooner allow him a horse-pond .
If burning the footmen's shoes , frightening the maids , and worrying the kittens be humour , he has it .
It was but yesterday he fastened my wig to the back of my chair , and when I went to make a bow , I popt my bald head in Mrs. Frizzle's face .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
And am I to blame ?
The poor boy was always too sickly to do any good .
A school would be his death .
When he comes to be a=little stronger , who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him ?
Hardcastle . Latin for him !
A cat and fiddle .
No , no ;
the alehouse and the stable are the only schools he_ _ll ever go to . Mrs .
Hardcastle . Well , we must not snub the poor boy now , for I believe we shall_ _n't have him long among us .
Anybody that looks in his face may see he_ _s consumptive .
Hardcastle . Ay , if growing too fat be one of the symptoms . Mrs .
Hardcastle . He coughs sometimes .
Hardcastle . Yes , when his liquor goes the wrong way . Mrs . Hardcastle .
I_ _m actually afraid of his lungs . Hardcastle . And truly so am I ;
for he sometimes whoops like a speaking trumpet -- ( Tony hallooing behind the scenes ) -- O , there he goes -- a very consumptive figure , truly .
Enter Tony , crossing the stage .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Tony , where are you going , my charmer ?
Will_ _n't you give papa and I a little of your company , lovee ?
Tony . I_ _m in haste , mother ; I can_ _not stay . Mrs .
Hardcastle . You shall_ _n't venture out this raw evening , my dear ;
you look most shockingly . Tony .
I can_ _n't stay , I tell you .
The Three=Pigeons expects me down every moment .
There's some fun going forward .
Hardcastle . Ay ;
the alehouse , the old place : I thought so .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
A low , paltry set of fellows . Tony . Not so low , neither .
There's Dick Muggins the exciseman , Jack Slang the horse doctor , Little=Aminadab that grinds the music box , and Tom=Twist that spins the pewter platter .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Pray , my dear , disappoint them for one night at least .
Tony . As=for disappointing them , I should not so much mind ;
Hardcastle . ( detaining him . ) You shall_ _n't go .
Tony . I will , I tell you . Mrs .
Hardcastle . I say you shall_ _n't . Tony .
We_ _ll see which is strongest , you or I . [ Exit , hauling her out .
] Hardcastle . ( solus .
) Ay , there goes a pair that only spoil each other .
But is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and discretion out=of doors ?
There's my pretty darling Kate ! the fashions of the times have almost infected her too .
By living a year or two in town , she is as fond of gauze and French frippery as the best of them .
Enter Miss=hardcastle . Hardcastle . Blessings on my pretty innocence !
drest out as=usual , my Kate .
Goodness !
What a quantity of superfluous silk hast thou got about thee , girl !
I could never teach the fools of this age , that the indigent world could be clothed out=of the trimmings of the vain .
Miss=hardcastle . You know our agreement , sir .
Well , remember , I insist on the terms of our agreement ;
and , by the bye , I believe I shall have occasion to try your obedience this very evening .
Then to be plain with you , Kate , I expect the young gentleman I have chosen to be your husband from town this very day .
I have his father's letter , in which he informs me his son is set out , and that he intends to follow himself shortly after .
Miss=hardcastle .
Indeed !
I wish I had known something of this before .
Bless me , how shall I behave ?
It_ _s a thousand=to=one I shall_ _n't like him ;
our meeting will be so formal , and so like a thing of business , that I shall find no room for friendship or esteem .
Hardcastle .
Depend upon it , child , I_ _ll never control your choice ;
but Mr.=Marlow , whom I have pitched upon , is the son of my old friend , Sir Charles=Marlow , of whom you have heard me talk so-often .
The young gentleman has been bred a scholar , and is designed for an employment in the service of his country .
I am told he_ _s a man of an excellent understanding .
Miss=hardcastle . Is he ?
Hardcastle . Very generous .
Miss=hardcastle . I believe I shall like him .
Hardcastle . Young and brave .
Miss=hardcastle . I_ _m sure I shall like him .
Hardcastle . And very handsome . Miss=hardcastle .
My dear papa , say no=more , ( kissing his hand ) , he_ _s mine ;
I_ _ll have him .
Hardcastle . And , to crown all , Kate , he_ _s one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world .
Miss=hardcastle . Eh !
you have frozen me to death again .
That word Reserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments .
A reserved lover , it is said , always makes a suspicious husband .
Hardcastle .
On=the=contrary , modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues .
It was the very feature in his character that first struck me .
Miss=hardcastle . He must have more striking features to catch me , I promise you .
However , if he be so young , so handsome , and so everything as you mention , I believe he_ _ll do still .
I think I_ _ll have him .
Hardcastle . Ay , Kate , but there is still an obstacle .
It_ _s more=than an even wager he may not have you .
Miss=hardcastle . My dear papa , why will you mortify one so ?
-- Well , if he refuses , instead=of breaking my heart at his indifference , I_ _ll only break my glass for its flattery , set my cap to some newer fashion , and look out for some less difficult admirer .
Hardcastle .
Bravely resolved !
In the mean time I_ _ll go prepare the servants for his reception : as we seldom see company , they want as much training as a company of recruits the first day's muster . [ Exit .
] Miss=hardcastle . ( Alone ) .
Lud , this news of papa's puts me all in a flutter .
Young , handsome : these he put last ;
but I put them foremost .
Sensible , good-natured ;
I like all that .
But then reserved and sheepish ; that_ _s much against him .
Yet can_ _n't he be cured of his timidity , by being taught to be proud of his wife ?
Yes , and can_ _n't I -- But I vow I_ _m disposing of the husband before I have secured the lover .
Enter Miss=neville . Miss=hardcastle .
I_ _m glad you_ _re come , Neville , my dear .
Tell me , Constance , how do I look this evening ?
Is there anything whimsical about me ?
Is it one of my well-looking days , child ?
Am=I in face to-day ?
Miss=neville . Perfectly , my dear .
Yet now I look again -- bless me ! -- sure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold fishes .
Has your brother or the cat been meddling ?
or has the last novel been too moving ?
Miss=hardcastle .
No ;
nothing of all this .
Miss=neville .
And his name -- Miss=hardcastle .
Is Marlow .
Miss=neville .
Indeed !
Miss=hardcastle .
The son of Sir=Charles=Marlow .
Miss=neville .
As I live , the most intimate friend of Mr.=Hastings , my admirer .
They are never asunder .
I believe you must have seen him when we lived in-town .
Miss=hardcastle . Never .
Miss=neville . He_ _s a very singular character , I assure you .
Among women of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive ;
but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp : you understand me .
Miss=hardcastle .
An odd character indeed .
I shall never be able to manage him .
What shall I do ?
Pshaw , think no=more of him , but trust to occurrences for success .
But how goes on your own affair , my dear ?
has my mother been courting you for my brother Tony as=usual ? Miss=neville .
I have just come from one of our agreeable tete-a-tetes . She has been saying a hundred tender things , and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection .
Miss=hardcastle . And her partiality is such , that she actually thinks him so .
A fortune like yours is no small temptation .
Besides , as she has the sole management of it , I_ _m not surprised to see her unwilling to let it go out=of the family .
Miss=neville . A fortune like mine , which chiefly consists in jewels , is no=such mighty temptation .
But at=any=rate , if my dear Hastings be but constant , I make no doubt to be too hard for her at=last .
However , I let her suppose that I am in=love with her son ;
and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another .
Miss=hardcastle . My good brother holds out stoutly . I could almost love him for hating you so .
Miss=neville . It is a good-natured creature at bottom , and I_ _m sure would wish to see me married to anybody but himself .
But my aunt's bell rings for our afternoon's walk round the improvements .
Allons !
Courage is necessary , as our affairs are critical .
Miss=hardcastle .
« Would=it=were=bed-time,=and=all=were=well . » [ Exeunt .
] Scene -- An Alehouse=Room .
Several shabby Fellows with punch and tobacco .
Tony at the head of the table , a=little higher than the rest , a mallet in his hand .
Omnes . Hurrea !
hurrea !
hurrea !
bravo !
First Fellow Now , gentlemen , silence for a song .
The ' squire is going to knock himself down for a song . Omnes .
Ay , a song , a song !
Tony .
Then I_ _ll sing you , gentlemen , a song I made upon this alehouse , the Three=Pigeons .
Song .
Let schoolmasters puzzle their brain With grammar , and nonsense , and learning , Good liquor , I stoutly maintain , Gives Genus a better discerning .
Let them brag of their heathenish gods , Their Lethes , their Styxes , and Stygians , Their Quis , and their Quaes , and their Quods , They_ _re all=but a parcel of Pigeons .
Toroddle , toroddle , toroll .
When methodist preachers come down , A-preaching that drinking is sinful , I_ _ll wager the rascals a crown , They always preach best with a skinful .
Toroddle , toroddle , toroll .
Then come , put the jorum about , And let us be merry and clever , Our hearts and our liquors are stout , Here's the Three=Jolly=Pigeons for=ever .
Let some cry up woodcock or hare , Your bustards , your ducks , and your widgeons ;
But of all the Gay birds in the air , Here's a health to the Three=Jolly=Pigeons .
Bravo , bravo !
First Fellow .
The ' squire has got spunk in him . Second Fellow .
I loves to hear him sing , bekeays he never gives us nothing that_ _s low . Third Fellow .
O damn anything that_ _s low , I can_ _not bear it .
Fourth Fellow .
The genteel thing is the genteel thing any time : if=so be that a gentleman bees in a concatenation accordingly .
Third Fellow .
I likes the maxum of it , Master Muggins .
What , though I am obligated to dance a bear , a man may be a gentleman for=all=that .
May this be my poison , if my bear ever dances but to the very genteelest of tunes ;
« Water Parted , » or « The=minuet=in=Ariadne . »
Second Fellow . What a pity it is the ' squire is not come to his own .
It would be well for all the publicans within ten miles round of him .
Tony . Ecod , and so it would , Master Slang .
I_ _d then show what it was to keep choice of company .
Second Fellow . O he takes after his own father for that .
To be sure old ' Squire Lumpkin was the finest gentleman I ever set my eyes on .
For winding the straight horn , or beating a thicket for a hare , or a wench , he never had his fellow .
It was a saying in the place , that he kept the best horses , dogs , and girls , in the whole county .
Tony . Ecod , and when I_ _m of age , I_ _ll be no bastard , I promise you .
I have been thinking of Bet=Bouncer and the miller's grey mare to begin with .
But come , my boys , drink about and be merry , for you pay no reckoning .
Well , Stingo , what's the matter ? Enter Landlord .
Landlord .
There be two gentlemen in a post-chaise at the door .
They have lost their way upo' the forest ;
and they are talking something about Mr.=Hardcastle . Tony .
As sure as can be , one of them must be the gentleman that_ _s coming down to court my sister .
Do they seem to be Londoners ?
Then desire them to step this way , and I_ _ll set them right in a twinkling . ( Exit Landlord .
) Gentlemen , as they mayn't be good enough company for you , step down for a moment , and I_ _ll be with you in the squeezing of a lemon . [ Exeunt mob .
] Tony . ( solus ) . Father-in-law has been calling me whelp and hound this half year .
Now , if I pleased , I could be so revenged upon the old grumbletonian .
But then I_ _m afraid -- afraid of what ?
I shall soon be worth fifteen hundred a year , and let him frighten me out=of That if he can .
I own , Hastings , I am unwilling to lay myself under an obligation to every one I meet , and often stand the chance of an unmannerly answer .
Hastings .
At=present , however , we are not likely to receive any answer .
Tony . No offence , gentlemen .
But I'm told you have been inquiring for one Mr.=Hardcastle in these parts .
Do you know what part of the country you are in ?
Hastings . Not in the least , sir , but should thank you for information .
Tony . Nor the way you came ? Hastings .
No , sir : but if you can inform us ----
Tony .
Why , gentlemen , if you know neither the road you are going , nor where you are , nor the road you came , the first thing I have to inform you is , that -- you have lost your way .
Marlow . We wanted no ghost to tell us that .
Tony . Pray , gentlemen , may I be so bold so=as=to ask the place from whence you came ?
Marlow . That's not necessary towards directing us where we are to go .
Tony . No offence ;
but question for question is all fair , you know .
Pray , gentlemen , is not this same Hardcastle a cross-grained , old-fashioned , whimsical fellow , with an ugly face , a daughter , and a pretty son ?
Hastings . We have not seen the gentleman ; but he has the family you mention .
Tony . The daughter , a tall , trapesing , trolloping , talkative maypole ;
the son , a pretty , well-bred , agreeable youth , that everybody is fond of .
Marlow . Our information differs in this .
The daughter is said to be well-bred and beautiful ;
the son an awkward booby , reared up and spoiled at his mother's apron-string .
Tony .
He-he-hem !
-- Then , gentlemen , all I have to tell you is , that you will_ _n't reach Mr.=Hardcastle's house this night , I believe .
Hastings . Unfortunate !
Tony . It_ _s a damn'd long , dark , boggy , dirty , dangerous way .
Stingo , tell the gentlemen the way to Mr.=Hardcastle's ! ( Winking upon the Landlord .
) Mr.=Hardcastle's , of Quagmire=Marsh , you understand me .
Landlord .
Master Hardcastle's ! Lock-a-daisy , my masters , you_ _re come a deadly deal wrong ! When you came to the bottom of the hill , you should have crossed down Squash=Lane . Marlow .
Cross down Squash=Lane ! Landlord .
Then you were to keep straight-forward , till you came to four roads . Marlow .
Come to where four roads meet ?
Then keeping to the right , you are to go sideways till you come upon Crackskull=Common : there you must look sharp for the track of the wheel , and go forward till you come to farmer Murrain's barn .
Coming to the farmer's barn , you are to turn to the right , and then to the left , and then to the right about again , till you find out the old mill --
Marlow . Zounds , man ! we could as soon find out the longitude ! Hastings .
What's to be done , Marlow ? Marlow .
This house promises but a poor reception ;
though perhaps the landlord can accommodate us .
Landlord . Alack , master , we have but one spare bed in the whole house . Tony .
And to my knowledge , that_ _s taken up by three lodgers already . ( After a pause , in which the rest seem disconcerted .
) I have hit it .
I hate sleeping by the fire-side . Marlow .
And I detest your three chairs and a bolster .
Tony . You do , do you ?
then , let me see -- what if you go on a mile further , to the Buck's Head ;
O ho ! so we have escaped an adventure for this night , however .
Landlord . ( apart to Tony ) .
Sure , you ben't sending them to your father's as an inn , be you ?
Tony . Mum , you fool you .
Let Them find that out . ( To them .
) You have only to keep on straight-forward , till you come to a large old house by the road side .
You_ _ll see a pair of large horns over the door .
That's the sign .
Drive up the yard , and call stoutly about you .
Hastings . Sir , we are obliged to you .
The servants can_ _n't miss the way ?
Tony .
No , no : but I tell you , though , the landlord is rich , and going to leave off business ;
so he wants to be thought a gentleman , saving your presence , he !
he !
he !
A troublesome old blade , to be sure ;
but a keeps as good wines and beds as any in the whole country . Marlow .
Well , if he supplies us with these , we shall want no farther connexion .
We are to turn to the right , did you say ?
Tony . No , no ; straight-forward .
I_ _ll just step myself , and show you a piece of the way . ( To the Landlord .
) Mum ! Landlord .
Ah , bless your heart , for a sweet , pleasant -- damn'd mischievous son of a whore . [ Exeunt .
] Act The Second . Scene -- An old-fashioned House .
Well , I hope you are perfect in the table exercise I have been teaching you these three days .
You all know your posts and your places , and can show that you have been used to good company , without ever stirring from home .
Omnes . Ay , ay .
Hardcastle . When company comes you are not to pop out and stare , and then run in again , like frightened rabbits in a warren . Omnes . No , no.
Hardcastle .
You , Diggory , whom I have taken from the barn , are to make a show at the side-table ;
and you , Roger , whom I have advanced from the plough , are to place yourself behind my chair .
But you_ _re not to stand so , with your hands in your pockets .
Take your hands from your pockets , Roger ; and from your head , you blockhead you .
See how Diggory carries his hands . They_ _re a little too stiff , indeed , but that_ _s no great matter .
Diggory . Ay , mind how I hold them .
I learned to hold my hands this way when I was upon drill for the militia .
And so being upon drill ----
Hardcastle .
You must not be so talkative , Diggory .
You must be all attention to the guests .
You must hear us talk , and not think of talking ;
you must see us drink , and not think of drinking ;
you must see us eat , and not think of eating .
Diggory .
By the laws , your worship , that_ _s parfectly unpossible .
Whenever Diggory sees yeating going forward , ecod , he_ _s always wishing for a mouthful himself .
Hardcastle . Blockhead !
Is not a belly-full in the kitchen as good as a belly-full in the parlour ?
Stay your stomach with that reflection .
Diggory . Ecod , I thank your worship , I_ _ll make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry .
Diggory , you are too talkative .
Then ecod your worship must not tell the story of Ould Grouse in the gun-room : I can_ _n't help laughing at that -- he !
he !
he !
-- for the soul of me .
We have laughed at that these twenty years -- ha !
ha !
ha !
Hardcastle . Ha !
ha !
ha !
The story is a good one .
Well , honest Diggory , you may laugh at that -- but still remember to be attentive .
Suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine , how will you behave ?
A glass of wine , sir , if you please ( to Diggory ) .
-- Eh , why do_ _n't you move ?
Diggory .
Ecod , your worship , I never have courage till I see the eatables and drinkables brought upo' the table , and then I_ _m as bauld as a lion .
Hardcastle .
What , will nobody move ?
First Servant .
I_ _m not to leave this pleace .
Second Servant .
I_ _m sure it_ _s no pleace of mine .
Third Servant .
Nor mine , for sartain .
Diggory .
Wauns , and I_ _m sure it canna be mine .
Hardcastle .
You numskulls !
and so while , like your betters , you are quarrelling for places , the guests must be starved . O you dunces !
I find I must begin all=over again ---- But do_ _n't I hear a coach drive into the yard ?
To your posts , you blockheads .
I_ _ll go in the mean time and give my old friend's son a hearty reception at the gate . [ Exit Hardcastle . ] Diggory .
By the elevens , my pleace is gone quite out=of my head . Roger . I know that my pleace is to be everywhere .
First Servant .
Where the devil is mine ?
Second Servant . My pleace is to be nowhere at=all ;
Enter Servant with candles , showing in Marlow and Hastings .
Servant . Welcome , gentlemen , very welcome !
This way . Hastings .
After the disappointments of the day , welcome once=more , Charles , to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire .
Upon my word , a very well-looking house ;
antique but creditable .
Marlow . The usual fate of a large mansion .
Having first ruined the master by good housekeeping , it at=last comes to levy contributions as an inn .
Hastings . As you say , we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries .
Travellers , George , must pay in all places : the only difference is , that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries ;
in bad inns you are fleeced and starved .
Hastings . You have lived very much among them .
In truth , I have been often surprised , that you who have seen so much of the world , with your natural good sense , and your many opportunities , could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance .
Marlow . The Englishman's malady .
But tell me , George , where could I have learned that assurance you talk of ?
My life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn , in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence .
I do_ _n't know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest woman -- except my mother -- But among females of another class , you know ----
But in the company of women of reputation I never saw such an idiot , such a trembler ;
you look for all the world as=if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out=of the room . Marlow . Why , man , that_ _s because I do want to steal out=of the room .
Faith , I have often formed a resolution to break the ice , and rattle away at=any=rate .
But I do_ _n't know how , a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution .
An impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty ; but I_ _ll be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence . Hastings . If you could but say half the fine things to them that I have heard you lavish upon the bar-maid of an inn , or even a college bed-maker ----
Marlow . Why , George , I can_ _n't say fine things to them ; they freeze , they petrify me . They may talk of a comet , or a burning mountain , or some=such bagatelle ;
but , to me , a modest woman , drest out in all her finery , is the most tremendous object of the whole creation .
Hastings . Ha !
ha !
ha !
At this rate , man , how can you ever expect to marry ?
Marlow . Never ; unless , as among kings and princes , my bride were to be courted by=proxy .
If , indeed , like an Eastern bridegroom , one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before , it might be endured .
But to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship , together with the episode of aunts , grandmothers , and cousins , and at=last to blurt out the broad staring question of , Madam , will you marry me ?
No , no , that_ _s a strain much above me , I assure you .
Hastings . I pity you .
But how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father ?
Marlow . As I behave to all other ladies .
Bow very low , answer yes or no to all her demands -- But=for the rest , I do_ _n't think I shall venture to look in her face till I see my father's again .
Hastings . I_ _m surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover .
Marlow . To be explicit , my dear Hastings , my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness , not my own .
Miss Neville loves you , the family do_ _n't know you ;
as my friend you are sure of a reception , and let honour do the rest .
Hastings .
My dear Marlow !
But=I_ _ll suppress the emotion .
Were I a wretch , meanly seeking to carry off a fortune , you should be the last man in the world I would apply to for assistance .
But Miss=Neville's person is all I ask , and that is mine , both from her deceased father's consent , and her own inclination .
Marlow . Happy man !
You have talents and art to captivate any woman .
I_ _m doom'd to adore the sex , and yet to converse with the only part of it I despise .
This stammer in my address , and this awkward prepossessing visage of mine , can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliner's ' prentice , or one of the duchesses of Drury-lane .
Pshaw !
this fellow here to interrupt us .
Enter Hardcastle . Hardcastle . Gentlemen , once=more you are heartily welcome .
Which is Mr.=Marlow ?
Sir , you are heartily welcome .
It_ _s not my way , you see , to receive my friends with my back to the fire .
I like give them a hearty reception in the old style at my gate . I like to see their horses and trunks taken care of . Marlow . ( Aside .
) He has got our names from the servants already . ( To him .
) We approve your caution and hospitality , sir . ( To Hastings .
) I have been thinking , George , of changing our travelling dresses in the morning .
I am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine .
Hardcastle . I beg , Mr.=Marlow , you_ _ll use no ceremony in this house .
Hastings . I fancy , Charles , you_ _re right : the first blow is half the battle .
I intend opening the campaign with the white and gold .
Hardcastle . Mr.=Marlow -- Mr.=Hastings -- gentlemen -- pray be under no constraint in this house .
This is Liberty-hall , gentlemen .
You may do just as you please here . Marlow .
Yet , George , if we open the campaign too fiercely at=first , we may want ammunition before it is over .
I think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat .
Hardcastle . Your talking of a retreat , Mr.=Marlow , puts me in mind of the Duke=of=Marlborough , when we went to besiege Denain . He first summoned the garrison ----
Now , says the Duke=of=Marlborough to George=Brooks , that stood next=to him -- you must have heard of George=Brooks -- I_ _ll pawn my dukedom , says he , but I take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood .
So ----
Marlow .
What , my good friend , if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time ;
it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour .
Hardcastle . Punch , sir ! ( Aside .
) This is the most unaccountable kind of modesty I ever met with .
Marlow . Yes , sir , punch .
A glass of warm punch , after our journey , will be comfortable .
This is Liberty-hall , you know .
Hardcastle . Here's a cup , sir .
Marlow . ( Aside . ) So this fellow , in his Liberty-hall , will only let us have just what he pleases .
Hardcastle . ( Taking the cup . ) I hope you_ _ll find it to your mind . I have prepared it with my own hands , and I believe you_ _ll own the ingredients are tolerable .
Will you be so good as=to pledge me , sir ?
Here , Mr.=Marlow , here is to our better acquaintance . [ Drinks .
] Marlow . ( Aside . ) A very impudent fellow this !
but he_ _s a character , and I_ _ll humour him a little .
From the excellence of your cup , my old friend , I suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country .
Warm work , now=and=then , at elections , I suppose .
Hardcastle .
No , sir , I have long given that work over .
So , then , you have no turn for politics , I find .
Hardcastle . Not in the least .
There was a time , indeed , I fretted myself about the mistakes of government , like other people ; but finding myself every day grow more angry , and the government growing no better , I left it to mend itself .
Since that , I no=more trouble my head about Hyder=Ally , or Ally=Cawn , than about Ally=Croker .
Sir , my service to you .
Hastings . So=that with eating above stairs , and drinking below , with receiving your friends within , and amusing them without , you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it .
Hardcastle . I do stir about a great deal , that_ _s certain .
Half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour .
Marlow . ( After drinking . ) And you have an argument in your cup , old gentleman , better than any in Westminster-hall .
Hardcastle . Ay , young gentleman , that , and a little philosophy .
So then , like an experienced general , you attack them on every quarter .
If you find their reason manageable , you attack it with your philosophy ;
if you find they have no reason , you attack them with this .
Hardcastle . Good , very good , thank you ; ha !
ha !
Your generalship puts me in mind of Prince=Eugene , when he fought the Turks at the battle of Belgrade .
You shall hear .
Marlow . Instead=of the battle of Belgrade , I believe it_ _s almost time to talk about supper .
What has your philosophy got in the house for supper ?
Hardcastle . For supper , sir ! ( Aside .
) Was ever such a request to a man in his own house ?
Marlow .
Yes , sir , supper , sir ;
I begin to feel an appetite .
I shall make devilish work to-night in the larder , I promise you .
Hardcastle . ( Aside . ) Such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld . ( To him .
) Why , really , sir , as=for supper I can_ _n't well tell .
My Dorothy and the cook-maid settle these things between them .
I leave these kind of things entirely to them .
Marlow . You do , do you ?
Hardcastle . Entirely .
Then I beg they_ _ll admit me as one of their privy council .
It_ _s a way I have got .
When I travel , I always chose to regulate my own supper .
Let the cook be called .
No offence I hope , sir .
Hardcastle . O no , sir , none in the least ;
yet I do_ _n't know how ; our Bridget , the cook-maid , is not very communicative upon these occasions .
Should we send for her , she might scold us all out=of the house . Hastings .
Let_ _s see your list of the larder then . I ask it as a favour .
I always match my appetite to my bill of fare .
Marlow . ( To Hardcastle , who looks at them with surprise .
) Sir , he_ _s very right , and it_ _s my way too . Hardcastle .
Sir , you have a right to command here .
Here , Roger , bring us the bill of fare for to-night's supper : I believe it_ _s drawn out -- Your manner , Mr.=Hastings , puts me in mind of my uncle , : el Wallop .
It was a saying of his , that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it .
Hastings . ( Aside . ) All upon the high rope !
His uncle a colonel !
we shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of the peace .
But let_ _s hear the bill of fare .
Marlow . ( Perusing .
) What's here ?
For the first course ;
for the second course ;
for the dessert .
The devil , sir , do you think we have brought down a whole Joiners' Company , or the corporation of Bedford , to eat up such a supper ?
Two or three little things , clean and comfortable , will do .
Hastings . But let_ _s hear it .
Marlow . ( Reading . ) For the first course , at the top , a pig and prune sauce .
Hastings .
Damn your pig , I say . Marlow .
And damn your prune sauce , say I . Hardcastle .
And yet , gentlemen , to men that are hungry , pig with prune sauce is very good eating . Marlow .
At the bottom , a calf's tongue and brains . Hastings .
Let your brains be knocked out , my good sir , I do_ _n't like them . Marlow .
Or you may clap them on a plate by themselves .
I do . Hardcastle . ( Aside .
) Their impudence confounds me . ( To them .
) Gentlemen , you are my guests , make what alterations you please .
Is there anything=else you wish to retrench or alter , gentlemen ? Marlow .
Item , a pork pie , a boiled rabbit and sausages , a Florentine , a shaking pudding , and a dish of tiff -- taff -- taffety cream .
Hastings . Confound your made dishes ;
I shall be as much at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow dinner at the French ambassador's table .
I_ _m for plain eating . Hardcastle .
I_ _m sorry , gentlemen , that I have nothing you like , but if there be anything you have a particular fancy to ----
Marlow .
Why , really , sir , your bill of fare is so exquisite , that any one part of it is full as good as another .
Send us what you please .
So much for supper . And now to see that our beds are aired , and properly taken care of .
Hardcastle . I entreat you_ _ll leave that to me .
You shall not stir a step .
Marlow . Leave that to you !
I must insist , sir , you_ _ll make yourself easy on that head .
Marlow .
You see I_ _m resolved on it . ( Aside .
) A very troublesome fellow this , as I ever met with . Hardcastle .
Well , sir , I_ _m resolved at=least to attend you . ( Aside .
) This may be modern modesty , but I never saw anything look so like old-fashioned impudence . [ Exeunt Marlow and Hardcastle .
] Hastings . ( Alone . ) So=I find this fellow's civilities begin to grow troublesome .
But who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him ?
Ha !
what do I see ?
Miss=Neville , by all that_ _s happy !
Enter Miss=neville . Miss=neville . My dear Hastings !
To what unexpected good fortune , to what accident , am I to ascribe this happy meeting ?
Hastings . Rather let me ask the same question , as I could never have hoped to meet my dearest Constance at an inn .
Miss=neville .
An inn !
sure you mistake : my aunt , my guardian , lives here .
What could induce you to think this house an inn ?
Hastings . My friend , Mr.=Marlow , with whom I came down , and I , have been sent here as=to an inn , I assure you .
A young fellow , whom we accidentally met at a house hard by , directed us hither .
Miss=neville .
Certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousin's tricks , of whom you have heard me talk so-often ;
ha !
ha !
ha !
Hastings .
He whom your aunt intends for you ?
he of whom I have such just apprehensions ?
Miss=neville . You have nothing to fear from him , I assure you .
You'd adore him , if you knew how heartily he despises me .
My aunt knows it too , and has undertaken to court me for him , and actually begins to think she has made a conquest .
Hastings .
Thou dear dissembler !
You must know , my Constance , I have just seized this happy opportunity of my friend's visit here to get admittance into the family .
The horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey , but they_ _ll soon be refreshed ;
and then , if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful Hastings , we shall soon be landed in France , where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected .
Miss=neville . I have often told you , that though ready to obey you , I yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance .
The greatest part of it was left me by my uncle , the India director , and chiefly consists in jewels .
I have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them .
I fancy I_ _m very near succeeding .
The instant they are put into my possession , you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours .
Hastings . Perish the baubles !
Your person is all I desire .
In the mean time , my friend Marlow must not be let into his mistake .
I know the strange reserve of his temper is such , that if abruptly informed of it , he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution .
Miss=neville . But how shall we keep him in the deception ?
Miss Hardcastle is just returned from walking ;
what if we still continue to deceive him ?
---- This , this way ---- [ They confer . ] Enter Marlow .
The assiduities of these good people teaze me beyond bearing .
My host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone , and so he claps not only himself , but his old-fashioned wife , on my back .
They talk of coming to sup with us too ;
and then , I suppose , we are to run the gantlet through all the rest of the family .
-- What have we got here ? Hastings .
My dear Charles !
Let me congratulate you !
-- The most fortunate accident !
-- Who do you think is just alighted ?
Marlow . Can_ _not guess .
Hastings .
Our mistresses , boy , Miss=Hardcastle and Miss=Neville .
Give me leave to introduce Miss=Constance=Neville to your acquaintance .
Happening to dine in the neighbourhood , they called on their return to take fresh horses here .
Miss=Hardcastle has just stept into the next room , and will be back in an instant .
Was_ _n't it lucky ?
eh ! Marlow . ( Aside .
) I have been mortified enough of all conscience , and here comes something to complete my embarrassment .
Hastings .
Well , but was_ _n't it the most fortunate thing in the world ?
Marlow . Oh !
yes .
Very fortunate -- a most joyful encounter -- But our dresses , George , you know are in disorder -- What if we should postpone the happiness till to-morrow ?
Miss=neville .
By=no=means , sir .
Your ceremony will displease her .
The disorder of your dress will show the ardour of your impatience .
Besides , she knows you are in the house , and will permit you to see her .
Marlow . O !
the devil ! how shall I support it ?
Hem !
hem !
Hastings , you must not go .
You are to assist me , you know .
I shall be confoundedly ridiculous .
Yet , hang it !
I_ _ll take courage .
Hem !
Hastings .
Pshaw , man !
it_ _s but the first plunge , and all's over .
She_ _s but a woman , you know .
Marlow . And , of all-women , she that I dread most to encounter .
) Now for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face , and quite in his own manner . ( After a pause , in which he appears very uneasy and disconcerted .
) I_ _m glad of your safe arrival , sir .
I_ _m told you had some accidents by=the=way . Marlow .
Only a=few , madam .
Yes , we had some .
Yes , madam , a good many accidents , but should be sorry -- madam -- or rather glad of any accidents -- that are so agreeably concluded .
Hem !
Hastings . ( To him . ) You never spoke better in your whole life . Keep it up , and I_ _ll insure you the victory .
Miss=hardcastle . I_ _m afraid you flatter , sir .
You that have seen so much of the finest company , can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country .
Marlow . ( Gathering courage . ) I have lived , indeed , in the world , madam ;
but I have kept very little company .
I have been but an observer upon life , madam , while others were enjoying it .
Miss=neville . But that , I am told , is the way to enjoy it at=last .
Hastings . ( To him . ) Cicero never spoke better .
Once=more , and you are confirmed in assurance for=ever .
Marlow . ( To him . ) Hem !
Stand by me , then , and when I_ _m down , throw in a word or two , to set me up again .
Miss=hardcastle . An observer , like you , upon life were , I fear , disagreeably employed , since you must have had much=more to censure than to approve .
Marlow . Pardon me , madam .
I was always willing to be amused .
The folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness .
Hastings . ( To him . ) Bravo , bravo .
Never spoke so well in your whole life .
Well , Miss=Hardcastle , I see that you and Mr.=Marlow are going to be very good company . I believe our being here will but embarrass the interview . Marlow .
Not in the least , Mr.=Hastings . We like your company of all things . ( To him .
) Zounds ! George , sure you will_ _n't go ?
how can you leave us ?
Hastings .
Our presence will but spoil conversation , so we_ _ll retire to the next room . ( To him .
) You do_ _n't consider , man , that we are to manage a little tete-a-tete of our own . [ Exeunt .
] Miss=hardcastle . ( after a pause ) .
But you have not been wholly an observer , I presume , sir : the ladies , I should hope , have employed some part of your addresses .
Marlow . ( Relapsing into timidity .
) Pardon me , madam , I -- I -- I -- as-yet have studied -- only -- to -- deserve them .
Miss=hardcastle . And that , some say , is the very worst way to obtain them .
Marlow . Perhaps so , madam .
But I love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sex . But I'm afraid I grow tiresome .
Miss=hardcastle . Not at=all , sir ;
there is nothing I like so much as grave conversation myself ;
I could hear it for=ever .
It_ _s ---- a disease ---- of the mind , madam .
In the variety of tastes there must be some who , wanting a relish ---- for ---- um -- a -- um .
Miss=hardcastle . I understand you , sir .
There must be some , who , wanting a relish for refined pleasures , pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting .
Miss=hardcastle . ( Aside .
) Who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon some occasions ? ( To him .
) You were going to observe , sir ----
Marlow . I was observing , madam -- I protest , madam , I forget what I was going to observe .
Miss=hardcastle . ( Aside . ) I vow and so do I . ( To him .
) You were observing , sir , that in this age of hypocrisy -- something about hypocrisy , sir .
Marlow .
Miss=hardcastle . I understand you perfectly , sir . Marlow . ( Aside .
) Egad ! and that_ _s more=than I do myself .
Miss=hardcastle . You mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practise in private , and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it .
Marlow . True , madam ;
those who have most virtue in their mouths , have least of it in their bosoms .
But I'm sure I tire you , madam . Miss=hardcastle .
Not in the least , sir ;
there_ _s something so agreeable and spirited in your manner , such life and force -- pray , sir , go on .
Marlow .
Yes , madam . I was saying ---- that there are some occasions , when a total want of courage , madam , destroys all the ---- and puts us ---- upon a -- a -- a -- Miss=hardcastle .
I agree with you entirely ;
a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance , and betrays us when we most want to excel . I beg you_ _ll proceed . Marlow .
Yes , madam .
Morally speaking , madam -- But I see Miss=Neville expecting us in the next room .
I would not intrude for the world .
I protest , sir , I never was more agreeably entertained in all my life .
Pray go on .
Marlow . Yes , madam , I was ---- But she beckons us to join her .
Madam , shall I do myself the honour to attend you ?
Miss=hardcastle .
Well , then , I_ _ll follow .
Marlow . ( Aside . ) This pretty smooth dialogue has done for me . [ Exit .
] Miss=hardcastle . ( Alone . ) Ha !
ha !
ha !
Was there ever such a sober , sentimental interview ?
I_ _m certain he scarce looked in my face the whole-time .
Yet the fellow , but=for his unaccountable bashfulness , is pretty well too .
He has good sense , but then so buried in his fears , that it fatigues one more=than ignorance .
If I could teach him a little confidence , it would be doing somebody that I know of a piece of service .
But who is that somebody ?
-- That , faith , is a question I can scarce answer . [ Exit . ]
Enter Tony and Miss=neville , followed by Mrs .
Hardcastle and Hastings . Tony .
What do you follow me for , cousin Con ?
I wonder you_ _re not ashamed to be so very engaging .
Miss=neville . I hope , cousin , one may speak to one's own relations , and not be to blame .
Tony .
Ay , but I know what sort of a relation you want to make me , though ;
but it will_ _n't do .
I tell you , cousin Con , it will_ _n't do ;
Mrs . Hardcastle . Well !
I vow , Mr.=Hastings , you are very entertaining .
There's nothing in the world I love to talk of so much as London , and the fashions , though I was never there myself .
Hastings . Never there !
You amaze me !
O ! sir , you_ _re only pleased to say so .
We country persons can have no manner at=all .
I_ _m in=love with the town , and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics ;
but who can have a manner , that has never seen the Pantheon , the Grotto=Gardens , the Borough , and such places where the nobility chiefly resort ?
All=I can do is to enjoy London at second-hand .
I take care to know every tete-a-tete from the Scandalous=Magazine , and have all the fashions , as they come out , in a letter from the two Miss=Rickets=of=Crooked=Lane .
Pray how do you like this head , Mr.=Hastings ?
Hastings . Extremely elegant and degagee , upon my word , madam .
Your friseur is a Frenchman , I suppose ? Mrs .
Hardcastle . I protest , I dressed it myself from a print in the Ladies' Memorandum-book for the last year .
Hastings . Indeed !
I vow , since inoculation began , there is no=such thing to be seen as a plain woman ;
so one must dress a little particular , or one may escape in the crowd .
Hastings . But that can never be your case , madam , in any dress . ( Bowing . ) Mrs .
Hardcastle . Yet , what signifies my dressing when I have such a piece of antiquity by my side as Mr.=Hardcastle : all I can say will never argue down a single button from his clothes .
I have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig , and where he was bald , to plaster it over , like my Lord=Pately , with powder .
Hardcastle . But what do you think his answer was ?
Why , with his usual Gothic vivacity , he said I only wanted him to throw off his wig , to convert it into a tete for my own wearing .
Hastings . Intolerable !
At your age you may wear what you please , and it must become you .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Hardcastle . Seriously .
Then I shall be too young for the fashion .
Hastings . No lady begins now to put on jewels till she_ _s past forty .
Hardcastle . And yet Mrs.=Niece thinks herself as much a woman , and is as fond of jewels , as the oldest of us all .
Hastings . Your niece , is she ?
And that young gentleman , a brother of yours , I should presume ? Mrs .
Hardcastle . My son , sir .
They are contracted to each=other .
Observe their little sports .
They fall in=and=out ten times a day , as if they were man and wife already . ( To them .
) Well , Tony , child , what soft things are you saying to your cousin Constance this evening ?
Hardcastle . Never mind him , Con , my dear .
He_ _s in another story behind your back . Miss=neville .
There's something generous in my cousin's manner .
He falls out before faces to be forgiven in private . Tony .
That's a damned confounded -- crack .
Mrs .
Hardcastle .
Ah !
he_ _s a sly one .
Do_ _n't you think they are like each=other about the mouth , Mr.=Hastings ?
The=Blenkinsop mouth to a T .
They_ _re of a size too .
Back to back , my pretties , that Mr.=Hastings may see you . Come , Tony .
Tony .
Hardcastle . O , the monster !
For shame , Tony .
You a man , and behave so !
Tony .
If I'm a man , let me have my fortin .
Ecod ! I_ _ll not be made a fool of no=longer .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Is this , ungrateful boy , all that I_ _m to get for the pains I have taken in your education ?
I that have rocked you in your cradle , and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon !
Did not I work that waistcoat to make you genteel ?
Did not I prescribe for you every-day , and weep while the receipt was operating ? Tony .
Ecod ! you had reason to weep , for you have been dosing me ever since I was born .
I have gone through every receipt in the Complete Huswife ten times over ;
and you have thoughts of coursing me through Quincy next spring .
Hardcastle . Was_ _n't it all for your good , viper ?
Was_ _n't it all for your good ?
Tony . I wish you_ _d let me and my good alone , then .
Snubbing this way when I_ _m in spirits . If I'm to have any good , let it come of itself ;
not to keep dinging it , dinging it into one so .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
That's false ;
I never see you when you_ _re in spirits .
No , Tony , you then go to the alehouse or kennel .
I_ _m never to be delighted with your agreeable wild notes , unfeeling monster ! Tony .
Ecod ! mamma , your own notes are the wildest of the two .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Was ever the like ?
But=I see he wants to break my heart , I see he does .
Hastings . Dear madam , permit me to lecture the young gentleman a little .
I_ _m certain I can persuade him to his duty .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Well , I must retire .
Come , Constance , my love .
You see , Mr.=Hastings , the wretchedness of my situation : was ever poor woman so plagued with a dear sweet , pretty , provoking , undutiful boy ? [ Exeunt Mrs .
Hardcastle and Miss=neville .
] Tony . ( Singing .
) " There was a young man riding by , and fain would have his will .
Rang do didlo dee .
" ---- Do_ _n't mind her .
Let her cry .
It_ _s the comfort of her heart .
I have seen her and sister cry over a book for an hour together ;
Then you_ _re no friend to the ladies , I find , my pretty young gentleman ? Tony .
That's as I find ' um . Hastings . Not to her of your mother's choosing , I dare answer ?
And yet she appears to me a pretty well-tempered girl . Tony .
That's because you do_ _n't know her as=well=as I.=Ecod !
I know every inch about her ;
and there_ _s not a more bitter cantankerous toad in all Christendom .
Hastings . ( Aside .
) Pretty encouragement this for a lover !
Tony . I have seen her since the height of that .
To me she appears sensible and silent .
Tony . Ay , before company .
But when she_ _s with her playmate , she_ _s as loud as a hog in a gate . Hastings .
But there is a meek modesty about her that charms me .
Well , but you must allow her a little beauty .
-- Yes , you must allow her some beauty .
Tony . Bandbox !
She_ _s all a made-up thing , mun .
Ah !
could you but see Bet=Bouncer of these parts , you might then talk of beauty .
Ecod , she has two eyes as black as sloes , and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit cushion .
She_ _d make two of she .
Hastings . Well , what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands ?
Tony . Anon .
but where is there such a friend , for who would take her ?
Hastings .
I am he .
If you but assist me , I_ _ll engage to whip her off to France , and you shall never hear more of her .
Tony . Assist you !
Ecod=I will , to the last drop of my blood .
I_ _ll clap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a twinkling , and may he get you a part of her fortin beside , in jewels , that you little dream of .
Come along , then , and you shall see more of my spirit before you have done with me .
( Singing .
) " We are the boys That fears no noise Where the thundering cannons roar . " [ Exeunt .
] Act The Third . Enter Hardcastle , alone .
Hardcastle . What could my old friend Sir=Charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in-town ?
To me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue .
He has taken possession of the easy chair by the fire-side already .
He took off his boots in the parlour , and desired me to see them taken care of .
I_ _m desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter .
She will certainly be shocked at it . Enter Miss=hardcastle , plainly dressed .
Hardcastle . Well , my Kate , I see you have changed your dress , as I bade you ;
and yet , I believe , there was no great occasion .
Miss=hardcastle . I find such a pleasure , sir , in obeying your commands , that I take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety .
Hardcastle . And yet , Kate , I sometimes give you some cause , particularly when I recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover to-day .
Miss=hardcastle . You taught me to expect something extraordinary , and I find the original exceeds the description .
Hardcastle . I was never so surprised in my life !
He has quite confounded all my faculties !
Miss=hardcastle . I never saw anything like it : and a man of the world too !
Hardcastle .
Ay , he learned it all abroad -- what a fool was I , to think a young man could learn modesty by travelling .
He might as soon learn wit at a masquerade .
Miss=hardcastle .
It seems all natural to him . Hardcastle .
A good deal assisted by bad company and a French dancing-master .
Miss=hardcastle .
Sure you mistake , papa !
A French dancing-master could never have taught him that timid look -- that awkward address -- that bashful manner --
Hardcastle .
Whose look ?
whose manner , child ? Miss=hardcastle .
Mr.=Marlow's : his mauvaise honte , his timidity , struck me at the first sight .
Hardcastle . Then your first sight deceived you ;
for I think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses .
Miss=hardcastle . Sure , sir , you rally !
I never saw any one so modest .
Hardcastle . And can you be serious ?
I never saw such a bouncing , swaggering puppy since I was born .
Bully=Dawson was but a fool to him .
Miss=hardcastle . Surprising !
He met me with a respectful bow , a stammering voice , and a look fixed on the ground .
Hardcastle . He met me with a loud voice , a lordly air , and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again .
Miss=hardcastle .
He treated me with diffidence and respect ;
censured the manners of the age ; admired the prudence of girls that never laughed ;
tired me with apologies for being tiresome ;
then left the room with a bow , and « Madam,=I=would=not=for=the=world=detain=you . »
Hardcastle . He spoke to me as=if he knew me all his life before ;
asked twenty questions , and never waited for an answer ;
interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun ; and when I was in my best story of the Duke=of=Marlborough and Prince=Eugene , he asked if I had not a good hand at making punch .
Yes , Kate , he asked your father if he was a maker of punch !
Miss=hardcastle .
One of us must certainly be mistaken . Hardcastle .
And if he be the sullen thing I take him , he shall never have mine .
Hardcastle . In one thing then we are agreed -- to reject him .
Miss=hardcastle .
Yes : but upon conditions .
For if you should find him less impudent , and I more presuming -- if you find him more respectful , and I more importunate -- I do_ _n't know -- the fellow is well enough for a man -- Certainly , we do_ _n't meet many=such at a horse-race in the country .
Hardcastle .
If we should find him so ---- But that_ _s impossible .
The first appearance has done my business .
I_ _m seldom deceived in that .
Miss=hardcastle . And yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance .
Hardcastle .
Ay , when a girl finds a fellow's outside to her taste , she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture .
With her , a smooth face stands for good sense , and a genteel figure for every virtue .
Miss=hardcastle . I hope , sir , a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense , will_ _n't end with a sneer at my understanding ?
Hardcastle . Pardon me , Kate .
But if young Mr.=Brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions , he may please us both , perhaps .
Agreed . But depend on't I_ _m in the right .
Miss=hardcastle . And depend on't I_ _m not=much in the wrong . [ Exeunt .
I have got them .
Here they are . My cousin Con's necklaces , bobs and all .
My mother shall_ _n't cheat the poor souls out=of their fortin neither .
O !
my genus , is that you ?
Enter Hastings . Hastings . My dear friend , how have you managed with your mother ?
I hope you have amused her with pretending love for your cousin , and that you are willing to be reconciled at=last ?
And here's something to bear your charges by=the=way ( giving the casket ) ;
your sweetheart's jewels .
Keep them : and hang those , I say , that would rob you of one of them .
Hastings . But how have you procured them from your mother ? Tony .
Ask me no questions , and I_ _ll tell you no fibs .
I procured them by the rule of thumb .
If I had not a key to every drawer in mother's bureau , how could I go to the alehouse so often as I do ?
An honest man may rob himself of his own at any time .
Hastings .
Thousands do it every-day .
But to be plain with you ;
Miss Neville is endeavouring to procure them from her aunt this very instant .
If she succeeds , it will be the most delicate way at=least of obtaining them .
Tony . Well , keep them , till you know how it will be .
But I know how it will be well enough ;
But I dread the effects of her resentment , when she finds she has lost them .
Tony .
Never you mind her resentment , leave Me to manage that .
I do_ _n't value her resentment the bounce of a cracker .
Zounds !
here they are .
Morrice !
Prance ! [ Exit Hastings . ] Enter Mrs .
Hardcastle and Miss=neville . Mrs . Hardcastle . Indeed , Constance , you amaze me .
Such a girl as you want jewels !
It will be time enough for jewels , my dear , twenty years hence , when your beauty begins to want repairs .
Hardcastle . Yours , my dear , can admit of none .
That natural blush is beyond a thousand ornaments .
Besides , child , jewels are quite out at=present .
Hardcastle . Consult your glass , my dear , and then see if , with such a pair of eyes , you want any better sparklers .
What do you think , Tony , my dear ?
does your cousin Con . want any jewels in your eyes to set off her beauty ?
Tony . That's as thereafter may be .
Miss=neville . My dear aunt , if you knew how it would oblige me .
Mrs .
Hardcastle . A parcel of old-fashioned rose and table-cut things .
They would make you look like the court of King Solomon at a puppet-show .
Besides , I believe , I can_ _n't readily come at them .
They may be missing , for aught I know to the contrary .
Tony . ( Apart to Mrs . Hardcastle .
) Then why do_ _n't you tell her so at once , as she_ _s so longing for them ?
Tell her they_ _re lost .
It_ _s the only way to quiet her .
Say they_ _re lost , and call me to bear witness . Mrs .
Hardcastle . ( Apart to Tony . ) You know , my dear , I_ _m only keeping them for you .
he !
he !
Tony . Never fear me .
Ecod ! I_ _ll say I saw them taken out with my own eyes .
Miss=neville . I desire them but=for a day , madam .
Hardcastle . To be plain with you , my dear Constance , if I could find them you should have them .
They_ _re missing , I assure you .
Lost , for aught I know ;
but we must have patience wherever they are .
Miss=neville . I_ _ll not believe it !
this is but a shallow pretence to deny me .
I know they are too valuable to be so slightly kept , and as you are to answer for the loss -- Mrs . Hardcastle . Do_ _n't be alarmed , Constance .
If they be lost , I must restore an equivalent .
But my son knows they are missing , and not to be found . Tony .
That I can bear witness to . They are missing , and not to be found ;
I_ _ll take my oath on't . Mrs .
Hardcastle . You must learn resignation , my dear ;
for though we lose our fortune , yet we should not lose our patience .
See me , how calm I am . Miss=neville .
Ay , people are generally calm at the misfortunes of others . Mrs .
Hardcastle . Now I wonder a girl of your good sense should waste a thought upon such trumpery .
I detest garnets . Mrs . Hardcastle .
The most becoming things in the world to set off a clear complexion .
You have often seen how well they look upon me .
You Shall have them . [ Exit .
] Miss=neville . I dislike them of all things .
You shall_ _n't stir .
-- Was ever anything so provoking , to mislay my own jewels , and force me to wear her trumpery ?
Tony . Do_ _n't be a fool .
If she gives you the garnets , take what you can get .
The jewels are your own already .
I have stolen them out=of her bureau , and she does not know it .
Fly to your spark , he_ _ll tell you more of the matter .
Leave me to manage her .
Miss=neville . My dear cousin !
Tony . Vanish .
She_ _s here , and has missed them already . [ Exit Miss Neville . ] Zounds !
how she fidgets and spits about like a Catherine wheel .
Enter Mrs . Hardcastle . Mrs .
Hardcastle .
Confusion !
thieves ! robbers !
we are cheated , plundered , broke open , undone .
Tony .
What's the matter , what's the matter , mamma ?
I hope nothing has happened to any of the good family !
Mrs . Hardcastle . We are robbed .
My bureau has been broken open , the jewels taken out , and I_ _m undone .
Tony . Oh !
is that all ? Ha !
ha !
ha !
By the laws , I never saw it acted better in my life .
Ecod , I thought you was ruined in earnest , ha !
ha !
ha !
Mrs .
Hardcastle . Why , boy , I Am ruined in earnest .
My bureau has been broken open , and all taken away .
Tony . Stick to that : ha !
ha !
ha !
stick to that .
I_ _ll bear witness , you know ; call me to bear witness . Mrs .
Sure I know they_ _re gone , and I_ _m to say so . Mrs .
Hardcastle . My dearest Tony , but hear me .
They_ _re gone , I say . Tony .
By the laws , mamma , you make me for to laugh , ha !
ha !
I know who took them well enough , ha ! ha !
ha !
Mrs . Hardcastle . Was there ever such a blockhead , that can_ _n't tell the difference between jest and earnest ?
I tell you I_ _m not in jest , booby . Tony .
That's right , that_ _s right ;
you must be in a bitter passion , and then nobody will suspect either of us .
I_ _ll bear witness that they are gone .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Was there ever such a cross-grained brute , that will_ _n't hear me ?
Can you bear witness that you_ _re no better than a fool ?
Was ever poor woman so beset with fools on one hand , and thieves on the other ?
Tony . I can bear witness to that .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Bear witness again , you blockhead you , and I_ _ll turn you out=of the room directly . My poor niece , what will become of her ?
Do you laugh , you unfeeling brute , as=if you enjoyed my distress ? Tony .
I can bear witness to that . Mrs .
Hardcastle . Do you insult me , monster ?
I_ _ll teach you to vex your mother , I will . Tony .
I can bear witness to that . [ He runs off , she follows him .
] Enter Miss=HARDCASTLE and Maid .
What an unaccountable creature is that brother of mine , to send them to the house as an inn ! ha !
ha !
I do_ _n't wonder at his impudence .
Maid . But what=is=more , madam , the young gentleman , as you passed by in your present dress , asked me if you were the bar-maid .
He mistook you for the bar-maid , madam .
Miss=hardcastle . Did he ?
Then as I live , I_ _m resolved to keep up the delusion .
Tell me , Pimple , how do you like my present dress ?
Do_ _n't you think I look something like Cherry in the Beaux=Stratagem ?
Maid . It_ _s the dress , madam , that every lady wears in the country , but when she visits or receives company .
Miss=hardcastle . And are you sure he does not remember my face or person ?
Maid . Certain of it .
Miss=hardcastle .
I vow , I thought so ; for , though we spoke for some time together , yet his fears were such , that he never once looked up during the interview .
Indeed , if he had , my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me .
Maid . But what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake ?
Miss=hardcastle . In the first place I shall be seen , and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market .
Then I shall perhaps make an acquaintance , and that_ _s no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex .
But my chief aim is , to take my gentleman off his guard , and , like an invisible champion of romance , examine the giant's force before I offer to combat .
Maid . But you are sure you can act your part , and disguise your voice so=that he may mistake that , as he has already mistaken your person ?
Miss=hardcastle .
Never fear me .
I think I have got the true bar cant -- Did your honour call ?
-- Attend the Lion there -- Pipes and tobacco for the Angel .
-- The Lamb has been outrageous this half-hour . Maid .
It will do , madam .
But he_ _s here . [ Exit Maid .
What a bawling in every part of the house !
I have scarce a moment's repose . If I go to the best room , there I find my host and his story : if I fly to the gallery , there we have my hostess with her curtsey down to the ground .
I have at=last got a moment to myself , and now for recollection . [ Walks and muses .
] Miss=hardcastle . Did you call , sir ?
Did your honour call ?
Marlow . ( Musing . ) As=for Miss=Hardcastle , she_ _s too grave and sentimental for me .
Miss=hardcastle . Did your honour call ? ( She still places herself before him , he turning away . )
Marlow . No , child . ( Musing .
) Besides , from the glimpse I had of her , I think she squints .
Miss=hardcastle . I_ _m sure , sir , I heard the bell ring .
Marlow . No , no. ( Musing .
) I have pleased my father , however , by coming down , and I_ _ll to-morrow please myself by returning . [ Taking out his tablets , and perusing .
] Miss=hardcastle . Perhaps the other gentleman called , sir ?
Marlow . I tell you , no.
Miss=hardcastle . I should be glad to know , sir .
We have such a parcel of servants !
Marlow .
No , no , I tell you . ( Looks full in her face .
) Yes , child , I think I did call .
I wanted -- I wanted -- I vow , child , you are vastly handsome .
Miss=hardcastle . O la , sir , you_ _ll make one ashamed .
Marlow . Never saw a more sprightly malicious eye .
Have you got any of your -- a -- what d'ye call it in the house ?
Miss=hardcastle .
No , sir , we have been out=of that these ten days .
Marlow . One may call in this house , I find , to very little purpose .
Suppose I should call for a taste , just by way of a trial , of the nectar of your lips ; perhaps I might be disappointed in that too .
Miss=hardcastle .
Nectar !
nectar ! That's a liquor there_ _s no call for in these parts .
French , I suppose .
We sell no French wines here , sir .
Marlow .
Of true English growth , I assure you .
Miss=hardcastle . Then it_ _s odd I should not know it .
We brew all sorts of wines in this house , and I have lived here these eighteen years .
Marlow .
Eighteen years ! Why , one would think , child , you kept the bar before you were born . How old are you ?
Miss=hardcastle . O !
sir , I must not tell my age .
They say women and music should never be dated . Marlow .
To guess at this distance , you can_ _n't be much above forty ( approaching ) .
Yet , nearer , I do_ _n't think so much ( approaching ) .
Miss=hardcastle . Pray , sir , keep your distance .
One would think you wanted to know one's age , as they do horses , by mark of mouth .
Marlow .
I protest , child , you use me extremely ill .
If you keep me at this distance , how is it possible you and I can ever be acquainted ?
Miss=hardcastle .
And who wants to be acquainted with you ?
I want no such acquaintance , not I .
I_ _m sure you did not treat Miss=Hardcastle , that was here awhile ago , in this obstropalous manner .
I_ _ll warrant me , before her you looked dashed , and kept bowing to the ground , and talked , for all the world , as=if you was before a justice of peace .
Marlow . ( Aside . ) Egad , she has hit it , sure enough ! ( To her .
) In awe of her , child ? Ha !
ha !
ha !
A mere awkward squinting thing ;
no , no. I find you do_ _n't know me . I laughed and rallied her a little ; but I was unwilling to be too severe .
No , I could not be too severe , curse me ! Miss=hardcastle .
O ! then , sir , you are a favourite , I find , among the ladies ? Marlow . Yes , my dear , a great favourite .
And yet hang me , I do_ _n't see what they find in me to follow .
At the Ladies' Club in town I_ _m called their agreeable Rattle . Rattle , child , is not my real name , but one I_ _m known by .
My name is Solomons ;
Mr.=Solomons , my dear , at your service . ( Offering to salute her .
) Miss=hardcastle . Hold , sir ;
you are introducing me to your club , not to yourself .
And you_ _re so great a favourite there , you say ?
Marlow . Yes , my dear .
There's Mrs.=Mantrap , Lady=Betty=Blackleg , the Countess=of=Sligo , Mrs.=Langhorns , old Miss=Biddy=Buckskin , and your humble servant , keep up the spirit of the place .
Miss=hardcastle . Then it_ _s a very merry place , I suppose ?
Marlow . Yes , as merry as cards , supper , wine , and old women can make us .
Miss=hardcastle . And their agreeable Rattle , ha ! ha ! ha ! Marlow . ( Aside .
) Egad ! I do_ _n't quite like this chit . She looks knowing , methinks .
You laugh , child ?
Miss=hardcastle . I can_ _n't but laugh , to think what time they all have for minding their work or their family .
Marlow . ( Aside .
) All's well ;
she do_ _n't laugh at me . ( To her . ) Do you ever work , child ?
Miss=hardcastle . Ay , sure .
There's not a screen or quilt in the whole house but what can bear witness to that .
Marlow . Odso !
then you must show me your embroidery . I embroider and draw patterns myself a little .
If you want a judge of your work , you must apply to me . ( Seizing her hand .
) Miss=hardcastle . Ay , but the colours do not look well by candlelight .
You shall see all in the morning . ( Struggling . )
Marlow . And why not now , my angel ?
Such beauty fires beyond the power of resistance .
-- Pshaw !
the father here !
My old luck : I never nicked seven that I did not throw ames ace three-times following . [ Exit Marlow . ] Enter Hardcastle , who stands in surprise .
Hardcastle .
So , madam . So , I find This is your Modest lover .
This is your humble admirer , that kept his eyes fixed on the ground , and only adored at humble distance .
Kate , Kate , art thou not ashamed to deceive your father so ?
Miss=hardcastle . Never trust me , dear papa , but he_ _s still the modest man I first took him for ;
you_ _ll be convinced of it as=well=as I .
Hardcastle . By the hand of my body , I believe his impudence is infectious !
Did_ _n't I see him seize your hand ?
Did_ _n't I see him haul you about like a milkmaid ?
And now you talk of his respect and his modesty , forsooth !
Miss=hardcastle .
But if I shortly convince you of his modesty , that he has only the faults that will pass off with time , and the virtues that will improve with age , I hope you_ _ll forgive him .
Hardcastle . The girl would actually make one run mad !
I tell you , I_ _ll not be convinced . I am convinced .
He has scarce been three hours in the house , and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives .
You may like his impudence , and call it modesty ; but my son-in-law , madam , must have very different qualifications .
Miss=hardcastle . Sir , I ask but this night to convince you . Hardcastle .
You shall not have half the time , for I have thoughts of turning him out this very hour .
Miss=hardcastle . Give me that hour then , and I hope to satisfy you .
Hardcastle .
Well , an hour let it be then .
But I_ _ll have no trifling with your father .
All fair and open , do you mind me .
Miss=hardcastle .
I hope , sir , you have ever found that I considered your commands as my pride ;
for your kindness is such , that my duty as yet has been inclination . [ Exeunt .
] Act The Fourth . Enter Hastings and Miss=neville .
Hastings .
You surprise me ; Sir=Charles=Marlow expected here this night !
Where have you had your information ?
Miss=neville . You may depend upon it .
Then , my Constance , all must be completed before he arrives . He knows me ;
and should he find me here , would discover my name , and perhaps my designs , to the rest of the family .
Miss=neville . The jewels , I hope , are safe ?
Hastings .
Yes , yes , I have sent them to Marlow , who keeps the keys of our baggage .
In the mean time , I_ _ll go to prepare matters for our elopement .
I have had the ' squire's promise of a fresh pair of horses ;
and if I should not see him again , will write him further directions . [ Exit .
] Miss=neville . Well ! success attend you .
Enter Marlow , followed by a Servant . Marlow .
I wonder what Hastings could mean by sending me so valuable a thing as a casket to keep for him , when he knows the only place I have is the seat of a post-coach at an inn-door .
Have you deposited the casket with the landlady , as I ordered you ?
Have you put it into her own hands ? Servant .
Yes , your honour . Marlow .
She said she_ _d keep it safe , did she ?
Servant . Yes , she said she_ _d keep it safe enough ;
she asked me how I came by it ;
and she said she had a great mind to make me give an account of myself . [ Exit Servant .
] Marlow . Ha !
ha !
ha !
They_ _re safe , however .
What an unaccountable set of beings have we got amongst !
This little bar-maid though runs in my head most strangely , and drives out the absurdities of all the rest of the family .
She_ _s mine , she must be mine , or I_ _m greatly mistaken .
Enter Hastings .
Hastings .
Bless me !
I quite forgot to tell her that I intended to prepare at the bottom of the garden . Marlow here , and in spirits too ! Marlow .
Give me joy , George !
Crown me , shadow me with laurels !
Well , George , after all , we modest fellows do_ _n't want for success among the women .
Hastings . Some women , you mean .
But what success has your honour's modesty been crowned with now , that it grows so insolent upon us ?
Well , and what then ?
Marlow . She_ _s mine , you rogue you . Such fire , such motion , such eyes , such lips ; but , egad !
she would not let me kiss them though .
Hastings .
But are you so sure , so very sure of her ?
Marlow . Why , man , she talked of showing me her work above stairs , and I am to improve the pattern . Hastings .
But how can you , Charles , go about to rob a woman of her honour ? Marlow . Pshaw ! pshaw !
We all know the honour of the bar-maid of an inn . I do_ _n't intend to rob her , take my word for it ;
there_ _s nothing in this house I shall_ _n't honestly pay for . Hastings .
I believe the girl has virtue .
Marlow . And if she has , I should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it .
Hastings . You have taken care , I hope , of the casket I sent you to lock up ?
Is it in safety ? Marlow .
Yes , yes .
It_ _s safe enough .
I have taken care of it .
But how could you think the seat of a post-coach at an inn-door a place of safety ?
Ah ! numskull !
I have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourself ---- I have ---- Hastings .
What ?
Marlow .
I have sent it to the landlady to keep for you .
Hastings .
To the landlady ! Marlow .
The landlady . Hastings .
You did ? Marlow . I did .
She_ _s to be answerable for its forthcoming , you know .
Hastings . Yes , she_ _ll bring it forth with a witness .
Marlow . Was_ _n't I right ?
I believe you_ _ll allow that I acted prudently upon this occasion .
Hastings . ( Aside .
) He must not see my uneasiness . Marlow .
You seem a little disconcerted though , methinks . Sure nothing has happened ?
Hastings .
No , nothing .
Never was in better spirits in all my life .
And so you left it with the landlady , who , no doubt , very readily undertook the charge .
Marlow . Rather too readily .
ha !
ha !
Hastings . He !
he !
he !
They_ _re safe , however . Marlow .
As a guinea in a miser's purse . Hastings . ( Aside .
) So now all hopes of fortune are at an end , and we must set off without it . ( To him .
) Well , Charles , I_ _ll leave you to your meditations on the pretty bar-maid , and , he !
he !
he !
Marlow . Thank ye , George : I ask no=more . Ha ! ha !
I no=longer know my own house .
It_ _s turned all topsy-turvy . His servants have got drunk already .
I_ _ll bear it no longer ;
and yet , from my respect for his father , I_ _ll be calm . ( To him .
) Mr.=Marlow , your servant .
Marlow . Sir , your humble servant . ( Aside .
) What's to be the wonder now ? Hardcastle .
I believe , sir , you must be sensible , sir , that no man alive ought=to be more welcome than your father's son , sir .
I hope you think so ? Marlow . I do from my soul , sir .
I do_ _n't want much entreaty .
I generally make my father's son welcome wherever he goes .
Hardcastle . I believe you do , from my soul , sir .
But though I say nothing to your own conduct , that of your servants is insufferable .
Their manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house , I assure you .
Marlow . I protest , my very good sir , that is no fault of mine .
If they do_ _n't drink as they ought , they are to blame .
I ordered them not to spare the cellar .
I did , I assure you . ( To the side scene .
) Here , let one of my servants come up . ( To him .
) My positive directions were , that as I did not drink myself , they should make up for my deficiencies below .
Hardcastle . Then they had your orders for what they do ?
I_ _m satisfied !
Marlow . They had , I assure you .
You shall hear from one of themselves .
Enter Servant , drunk . Marlow . You , Jeremy !
Come forward , sirrah !
What were my orders ?
Were you not told to drink freely , and call for what you thought fit , for the good of the house ? Hardcastle . ( Aside .
) I begin to lose my patience . Jeremy .
Please your honour , liberty and Fleet-street for=ever !
Though I_ _m but a servant , I_ _m as good as another man .
I_ _ll drink for no man before supper , sir , damme !
Good liquor will sit upon a good supper , but a good supper will not sit upon ---- hiccup ---- on my conscience , sir .
Marlow .
You see , my old friend , the fellow is as drunk as he can possibly be .
I do_ _n't know what you_ _d have more , unless you_ _d have the poor devil soused in a beer-barrel .
Hardcastle . Zounds !
he_ _ll drive me distracted , if I contain myself any longer . Mr.=Marlow -- Sir ;
I have submitted to your insolence for more than four hours , and I see no likelihood of its coming to an end .
I_ _m now resolved to be master here , sir ;
and I desire that you and your drunken pack may leave my house directly .
Marlow .
Leave your house ! ---- Sure you jest , my good friend !
What ? when I_ _m doing what I can to please you .
Hardcastle . I tell you , sir , you do_ _n't please me ;
so I desire you_ _ll leave my house .
Marlow . Sure you can_ _not be serious ? At this time o' night , and such a night ?
You only mean to banter me . Hardcastle .
I tell you , sir , I_ _m serious !
and now that my passions are roused , I say this house is mine , sir ;
this house is mine , and I command you to leave it directly .
Marlow . Ha !
ha !
ha !
A puddle in a storm .
I shall_ _n't stir a step , I assure you . ( In a serious tone .
) This your house , fellow ! It_ _s my house .
This is my house . Mine , while I choose to stay .
What right have you to bid me leave this house , sir ?
I never met with such impudence , curse me ;
never in my whole life before .
Hardcastle .
Nor I , confound me if ever I did . To come to my house , to call for what he likes , to turn me out=of my own chair , to insult the family , to order his servants to get drunk , and then to tell me , " This house is mine , sir .
" By all that_ _s impudent , it makes me laugh .
Ha ! ha !
ha !
Pray , sir ( bantering ) , as you take the house , what think you of taking the rest of the furniture ?
There's a pair of silver candlesticks , and there_ _s a fire-screen , and here's a pair of brazen-nosed bellows ; perhaps you may take a fancy to them ?
Marlow . Bring me your bill , sir ;
bring me your bill , and let_ _s make no more words about it .
Hardcastle . There are a set of prints , too .
What think you of the Rake's Progress , for your own apartment ?
Marlow . Bring me your bill , I say ;
and I_ _ll leave you and your infernal house directly .
Hardcastle .
Then there_ _s a mahogany table that you may see your own face in . Marlow . My bill , I say . Hardcastle .
I had forgot the great chair for your own particular slumbers , after a hearty meal .
Marlow . Zounds !
bring me my bill , I say , and let_ _s hear no=more on't .
Hardcastle . Young man , young man , from your father's letter to me , I was taught to expect a well-bred modest man as a visitor here , but now I find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully ;
but he will be down here presently , and shall hear more of it . [ Exit .
]
Marlow .
How's this ? Sure=I have not mistaken the house .
Everything looks like an inn .
The servants cry , coming ; the attendance is awkward ;
the bar-maid , too , to attend us .
But she_ _s here , and will further inform me .
Whither so fast , child ? A word with you .
Enter Miss=hardcastle . Miss=hardcastle .
Let it be short , then .
I_ _m in a hurry . ( Aside .
) I believe be begins to find out his mistake .
But it_ _s too=soon quite to undeceive him .
Marlow . Pray , child , answer me one question .
What are you , and what may your business in this house be ? Miss=hardcastle .
A relation of the family , sir .
Marlow .
What , a poor relation .
Miss=hardcastle . Yes , sir . A poor relation , appointed to keep the keys , and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them .
Marlow . That is , you act as the bar-maid of this inn .
Miss=hardcastle .
Inn !
O law ---- what brought that in your head ?
One of the best families in the country keep an inn -- Ha !
ha !
ha !
old Mr. Hardcastle's house an inn ! Marlow .
Mr.=Hardcastle's house !
Is this Mr.=Hardcastle's house , child ?
Miss=hardcastle .
Ay , sure !
Whose else should it be ?
Marlow .
So then , all's out , and I have been damnably imposed on .
O , confound my stupid head , I shall be laughed at over the whole town .
I shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the print-shops . The Dullissimo Maccaroni .
What a swaggering puppy must he take me for !
What a silly puppy do I find myself !
There again , may I be hanged , my dear , but I mistook you for the bar-maid .
Miss=hardcastle . Dear me ! dear me !
I_ _m sure there_ _s nothing in my Behaviour to put me on a level with one of that stamp .
Marlow . Nothing , my dear , nothing .
But I was in for a list of blunders , and could not help making you a subscriber .
My stupidity saw everything the wrong way .
I mistook your assiduity for assurance , and your simplicity for allurement .
But it_ _s over .
This house I no=more show My face in . Miss=hardcastle .
I hope , sir , I have done nothing to disoblige you .
I_ _m sure I should be sorry ( pretending to cry ) if he left the family upon my account .
I_ _m sure I should be sorry if people said anything amiss , since I have no fortune but my character .
Marlow . ( Aside . ) By=Heaven !
she weeps .
This is the first mark of tenderness I ever had from a modest woman , and it touches me . ( To her .
) Excuse me , my lovely girl ;
you are the only part of the family I leave with reluctance . But to be plain with you , the difference of our birth , fortune , and education , makes an honourable connexion impossible ;
and I can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honour , of bringing ruin upon one whose only fault was being too lovely . Miss=hardcastle . ( Aside . ) Generous man !
I now begin to admire him . ( To him .
) But=I am sure my family is as good as Miss=Hardcastle's ;
and though I_ _m poor , that_ _s no great misfortune to a contented mind ;
and , until this moment , I never thought that it was bad to want fortune .
Marlow . And why now , my pretty simplicity ?
Miss=hardcastle . Because it puts me at a distance from one that , if I had a thousand pounds , I would give it all to .
Marlow . ( Aside . ) This simplicity bewitches me , so=that if I stay , I_ _m undone .
I must make one bold effort , and leave her . ( To her .
) Your partiality in my favour , my dear , touches me most sensibly : and were I to live for myself alone , I could easily fix my choice .
so=that -- I can scarcely speak it -- it affects me .
Farewell . [ Exit .
]
Miss=hardcastle .
I never knew half his merit till now .
He shall not go , if I have power or art to detain him .
I_ _ll still preserve the character in which I Stooped To Conquer ;
but will undeceive my papa , who perhaps may laugh him out=of his resolution . [ Exit .
] Enter Tony and Miss=neville . Tony .
Ay , you may steal for yourselves the next time .
I have done my duty .
She has got the jewels again , that_ _s a sure thing ;
but she believes it was all a mistake of the servants . Miss=neville .
But , my dear cousin , sure you will_ _n't forsake us in this distress ?
To be sure , aunts of all kinds are damned bad things . But what can I do ? I have got you a pair of horses that will fly like Whistle-jacket ;
and I_ _m sure you can_ _n't say but I have courted you nicely before her face .
Here she comes , we must court a=bit or two more , for fear she should suspect us . [ They retire , and seem to fondle .
] Enter Mrs .
Hardcastle . Mrs .
Hardcastle . Well , I was greatly fluttered , to be sure .
But my son tells me it was all a mistake of the servants .
I shall_ _n't be easy , however , till they are fairly married , and then let her keep her own fortune .
But what do I see ?
fondling together , as I_ _m alive .
I never saw Tony so sprightly before .
Ah !
have I caught you , my pretty doves ?
What , billing , exchanging stolen glances and broken murmurs ?
Ah !
Tony .
As=for murmurs , mother , we grumble a little now=and=then , to be sure .
But there_ _s no love lost between us . Mrs .
Hardcastle . A mere sprinkling , Tony , upon the flame , only to make it burn brighter .
Miss=neville .
Cousin Tony promises to give us more of his company at home .
Indeed , he shall_ _n't leave us any=more .
It will_ _n't leave us , cousin Tony , will it ?
Tony . O !
it_ _s a pretty creature .
No , I_ _d sooner leave my horse in a pound , than leave you when you smile upon one so .
Your laugh makes you so becoming .
Miss=neville . Agreeable cousin !
Who can help admiring that natural humour , that pleasant , broad , red , thoughtless ( patting his cheek ) -- ah ! it_ _s a bold face . Mrs . Hardcastle . Pretty innocence !
Tony . I_ _m sure I always loved cousin Con . ' s hazle eyes , and her pretty long fingers , that she twists this way and that over the haspicholls , like a parcel of bobbins .
Mrs . Hardcastle . Ah !
he would charm the bird from the tree .
I was never so happy before .
My boy takes after his father , poor Mr. Lumpkin , exactly .
The jewels , my dear Con .
, shall be yours incontinently .
You shall have them .
Enter Diggory .
Diggory .
Where's the ' squire ?
I have got a letter for your worship .
Tony . Give it to my mamma .
She reads all my letters first . Diggory .
I had orders to deliver it into your own hands .
Tony . Who does it come from ?
Diggory . Your worship mun ask that o' the letter itself .
Tony . I could wish to know though ( turning the letter , and gazing on it ) .
A letter to him from Hastings .
I know the hand .
If my aunt sees it , we are ruined for ever .
I_ _ll keep her employed a little if I can . ( To Mrs .
Hardcastle .
) But=I have not told you , madam , of my cousin's smart answer just now to Mr.=Marlow .
We so laughed .
-- You must know , madam .
]
I can read your print hand very well .
But here are such handles , and shanks , and dashes , that one can scarce tell the head from the tail .
-- « To Anthony=Lumpkin , Esquire . »
It_ _s very odd , I can read the outside of my letters , where my own name is , well enough ;
but when I come to open it , it_ _s all ---- buzz .
That's hard , very hard ;
for the inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence .
Mrs . Hardcastle . Ha !
ha !
ha !
Very well , very well .
And so my son was too hard for the philosopher .
Miss=neville . Yes , madam ;
but you must hear the rest , madam .
A little more this way , or he may hear us .
You_ _ll hear how he puzzled him again . Mrs .
Hardcastle . He seems strangely puzzled now himself , methinks .
Tony . ( Still gazing . ) A damned up=and=down hand , as=if it was disguised in liquor .
-- ( Reading .
Hardcastle . What's that , my dear ?
Can=I give you any assistance ?
Miss=neville . Pray , aunt , let me read it .
Nobody reads a cramp hand better than I . ( Twitching the letter from him .
) Do you know who it is from ? Tony .
Can_ _n't tell , except from Dick Ginger , the feeder . Miss=neville .
Ay , so it is . ( Pretending to read .
) Dear ' Squire , hoping that you_ _re in health , as I am at this present .
The gentlemen of the Shake-bag club has cut the gentlemen of Goose-green quite out=of feather .
it_ _s of no consequence ;
)
Tony .
Here , mother , do you make it out .
Of no consequence ! ( Giving Mrs .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
How's this ?
-- ( Reads .
) " Dear Squire,=I m now waiting for Miss=Neville , with a post-chaise and pair , at the bottom of the garden , but I find my horses yet unable to perform the journey .
I expect you_ _ll assist us with a pair of fresh horses , as you promised .
Dispatch is necessary , as the Hag ( ay , the hag ) , your mother , will otherwise suspect us !
Yours , Hastings .
" Grant me patience .
I shall run distracted !
My rage chokes me .
Miss=neville . I hope , madam , you_ _ll suspend your resentment for a=few moments , and not impute to me any impertinence , or sinister design , that belongs to another .
Mrs . Hardcastle . ( Curtseying very low .
) Fine spoken , madam , you are most miraculously polite and engaging , and quite the very pink of courtesy and circumspection , madam . ( Changing her tone .
) And you , you great ill-fashioned oaf , with scarce sense enough to keep your mouth shut : were you , too , joined against me ?
But=I_ _ll defeat all your plots in a moment .
As=for you , madam , since you have got a pair of fresh horses ready , it would be cruel to disappoint them .
So , if you please , instead=of running away with your spark , prepare , this very moment , to run off with Me .
Your old aunt Pedigree will keep you secure , I_ _ll warrant me .
You too , sir , may mount your horse , and guard us upon the way .
Here , Thomas , Roger , Diggory !
Miss=neville . So now I_ _m completely ruined . Tony .
Ay , that_ _s a sure thing .
Miss=neville . What better could be expected from being connected with such a stupid fool , -- and after all the nods and signs I made him ?
Tony .
By the laws , miss , it was your own cleverness , and not my stupidity , that did your business .
You were so nice and so busy with your Shake-bags and Goose-greens , that I thought you could never be making believe .
Enter Hastings . Hastings . So , sir , I find by my servant , that you have shown my letter , and betrayed us .
Was this well-done , young gentleman ?
Tony . Here's another .
Ask miss there , who betrayed you .
Ecod , it was her doing , not mine .
Enter Marlow . Marlow .
So I have been finely used here among you .
Rendered contemptible , driven into ill manners , despised , insulted , laughed at .
Tony . Here's another .
We shall have old Bedlam broke loose presently .
Miss=neville . And there , sir , is the gentleman to whom we all owe every obligation .
A poor contemptible booby , that would but disgrace correction .
Miss=neville . Yet with cunning and malice enough to make himself merry with all our embarrassments .
Hastings . An insensible cub .
Marlow . Replete with tricks and mischief .
Tony . Baw !
damme , but I_ _ll fight you both , one after the other ---- with baskets . Marlow .
As=for him , he_ _s below resentment .
But your conduct , Mr. Hastings , requires an explanation .
You knew of my mistakes , yet would not undeceive me .
Hastings . Tortured as I am with my own disappointments , is this a time for explanations ?
But , sir ---- Miss=neville .
Mr.=Marlow , we never kept on your mistake till it was too late to undeceive you . Enter Servant . Servant . My mistress desires you_ _ll get ready immediately , madam .
The horses are putting to .
Your hat and things are in the next room .
Miss=neville . Well , well : I_ _ll come presently . Marlow . ( To Hastings .
) Was it well-done , sir , to assist in rendering me ridiculous ?
To hang me out for the scorn of all my acquaintance ?
Depend upon it , sir , I shall expect an explanation .
Mr.=Hastings ! Mr.=Marlow ! Why will you increase my distress by this groundless dispute ?
I implore , I entreat you ----
Enter Servant . Servant .
Your cloak , madam .
My mistress is impatient . [ Exit Servant .
] Miss=neville .
I come . Pray be pacified .
If I leave you thus , I shall die with apprehension .
Enter Servant . Servant . Your fan , muff , and gloves , madam .
The horses are waiting .
Miss=neville . O , Mr.=Marlow !
if you knew what a scene of constraint and ill-nature lies before me , I_ _m sure it would convert your resentment into pity .
Marlow . I_ _m so distracted with a variety of passions , that I do_ _n't know what I do .
Forgive me , madam . George , forgive me .
You know my hasty temper , and should not exasperate it .
Hastings . The torture of my situation is my only excuse .
Miss=neville .
Mrs .
Hardcastle . ( Within . ) Miss=Neville .
Constance , why Constance , I say .
Miss=neville .
I_ _m coming .
Well , constancy , remember , constancy is the word . [ Exit .
] Hastings .
My heart !
how can I support this ?
To be so near happiness , and such happiness !
Marlow . ( To Tony . ) You see now , young gentleman , the effects of your folly .
What might be amusement to you , is here disappointment , and even distress .
Tony . ( From a reverie . ) Ecod , I have hit it . It_ _s here .
Your hands .
Yours and yours , my poor Sulky !
-- My boots there , ho !
-- Meet me two hours hence at the bottom of the garden ; and if you do_ _n't find Tony Lumpkin a more good-natured fellow than you thought for , I_ _ll give you leave to take my best horse , and Bet=Bouncer into the bargain .
Come along .
My boots , ho ! [ Exeunt .
]
Enter Hastings and Servant . Hastings . You saw the old lady and Miss=Neville drive off , you say ?
Servant . Yes , your honour . They went off in a post-coach , and the young ' squire went on horseback .
They_ _re thirty miles off by this time . Hastings .
Then all my hopes are over . Servant .
Yes , sir .
Old Sir=Charles has arrived .
He and the old gentleman of the house have been laughing at Mr.=Marlow's mistake this half hour .
They are coming this way . Hastings .
Then I must not be seen .
So now to my fruitless appointment at the bottom of the garden .
Enter Sir=charles and Hardcastle .
Hardcastle . Ha !
ha !
ha !
The peremptory tone in which he sent forth his sublime commands ! Sir=charles .
And the reserve with which I suppose he treated all your advances . Hardcastle .
And yet he might have seen something in me above a common innkeeper , too .
Sir=charles . Yes , Dick , but he mistook you for an uncommon innkeeper , ha !
ha !
ha !
Hardcastle .
Well , I_ _m in too good spirits to think of anything but joy .
Yes , my dear friend , this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary ; and though my daughter's fortune is but small -- Sir=charles . Why , Dick , will you talk of fortune to Me ?
My son is possessed of more=than a competence already , and can want nothing but a good and virtuous girl to share his happiness and increase it .
If they like each=other , as you say they do -- Hardcastle .
If , man !
I tell you they DO like each=other .
My daughter as good as told me so .
Sir=charles . But girls are apt to flatter themselves , you know .
Hardcastle . I saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself ;
and here he comes to put you out=of your Ifs , I warrant him .
Enter Marlow . Marlow . I come , sir , once=more , to ask pardon for my strange conduct .
I can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion .
Hardcastle .
Tut , boy , a trifle !
You take it too gravely .
An hour or two's laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again .
She_ _ll never like you the worse for it . Marlow .
Sir , I shall be always proud of her approbation .
Hardcastle . Approbation is but a cold word , Mr.=Marlow ;
if I am not deceived , you have something more=than approbation thereabouts .
You take me ? Marlow .
Really , sir , I have not that happiness . Hardcastle .
Come , boy , I_ _m an old fellow , and know what's what as=well as you that are younger .
I know what has passed between you ;
but mum .
Marlow . Sure , sir , nothing has passed between us but the most profound respect on my side , and the most=distant reserve on hers .
You do_ _n't think , sir , that my impudence has been passed upon all the rest of the family .
Hardcastle .
Impudence !
No , I do_ _n't say that -- not=quite impudence -- though girls like to be played with , and rumpled a little too , sometimes .
But she has told no tales , I assure you . Marlow . I never gave her the slightest cause . Hardcastle .
Well , well , I like modesty in its place well enough . But this is over-acting , young gentleman .
You may be open . Your father and I will like you all the better for it .
Marlow . May I die , sir , if I ever ----
Hardcastle .
I tell you , she do_ _n't dislike you ; and as I_ _m sure you like her ----
Marlow .
Dear sir -- I protest , sir ----
Hardcastle .
I see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as the parson can tie you .
Marlow . But hear me , sir --
Hardcastle .
Your father approves the match , I admire it ;
every moment's delay will be doing mischief . So --
Marlow . But why will_ _n't you hear me ?
By all that_ _s just and true , I never gave Miss=Hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment , or even the most=distant hint to suspect me of affection .
We had but one interview , and that was formal , modest , and uninteresting .
Hardcastle . ( Aside . ) This fellow's formal modest impudence is beyond bearing .
Sir=charles . And you never grasped her hand , or made any protestations ?
Marlow . As Heaven is my witness , I came down in obedience to your commands .
I saw the lady without emotion , and parted without reluctance .
I_ _m astonished at the air of sincerity with which he parted . Hardcastle .
And I'm astonished at the deliberate intrepidity of his assurance .
Sir=charles . I dare pledge my life and honour upon his truth . Hardcastle .
Here comes my daughter , and I would stake my happiness upon her veracity .
Enter Miss=hardcastle . Hardcastle .
Kate , come hither , child .
Answer us sincerely and without reserve : has Mr.=Marlow made you any professions of love and affection ?
Miss=hardcastle .
The question is very abrupt , sir .
But since you require unreserved sincerity , I think he has .
Hardcastle . ( To Sir=charles . ) You see .
Sir=charles . And pray , madam , have you and my son had more=than one interview ?
Miss=hardcastle . Yes , sir , several .
Hardcastle . ( To Sir=charles . ) You see .
Sir=charles . But did be profess any attachment ?
Miss=hardcastle . A lasting one .
Sir=charles . Did he talk of love ?
Miss=hardcastle . Much , sir .
Sir=charles . Amazing !
And all this formally ?
Miss=hardcastle . Formally .
Hardcastle . Now , my friend , I hope you are satisfied .
Sir=charles . And how did he behave , madam ?
Miss=hardcastle .
As most profest admirers do : said some civil things of my face , talked much of his want of merit , and the greatness of mine ;
mentioned his heart , gave a short tragedy speech , and ended with pretended rapture .
Sir=charles .
Now I'm perfectly convinced , indeed . I know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive : this forward canting ranting manner by=no=means describes him ;
and , I am confident , he never sat for the picture .
Miss=hardcastle . Then , what , sir , if I should convince you to your face of my sincerity ?
If you and my papa , in about half an hour , will place yourselves behind that screen , you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person .
Sir=charles . Agreed .
Miss=hardcastle . And if you do_ _n't find him what I describe -- I fear my happiness must never have a beginning . [ Exeunt .
What an idiot am I , to wait here for a fellow who probably takes a delight in mortifying me .
He never intended to be punctual , and I_ _ll wait no=longer .
What do I see ?
It is he ! and perhaps with news of my Constance .
Enter Tony , booted and spattered .
Hastings . My honest ' squire !
I now find you a man of your word .
This looks like friendship .
This riding by night , by the bye , is cursedly tiresome .
It has shook me worse than the basket of a stage-coach .
Hastings . But how ?
where did you leave your fellow-travellers ?
Are they in safety ?
Are they housed ?
Tony .
Five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no=such bad driving .
The poor beasts have smoked for it : rabbit me , but I_ _d rather ride forty miles after a fox than ten with such varment .
Hastings . Well , but where have you left the ladies ?
I die with impatience .
Tony . Left them !
Why where should I leave them but where I found them ?
Hastings . This is a riddle .
Tony . Riddle me this then .
What's that goes round the house , and round the house , and never touches the house ?
Hastings . I_ _m still astray .
Tony . Why , that_ _s it , mon .
I have led them astray .
Ha ! ha ! ha !
I understand : you took them in a round , while they supposed themselves going forward , and so you have at=last brought them home again . Tony . You shall hear .
I first took them down Feather-bed Lane , where we stuck fast in the mud .
I then rattled them crack over the stones of Up-and-down Hill .
I then introduced them to the gibbet on Heavy-tree Heath ;
But no accident , I hope ? Tony .
No , no. Only mother is confoundedly frightened .
She thinks herself forty miles off .
She_ _s sick of the journey ; and the cattle can scarce crawl .
So if your own horses be ready , you may whip off with cousin , and I_ _ll be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow you .
Hastings . My dear friend , how can I be grateful ?
Tony . Ay , now it_ _s dear friend , noble ' squire .
Just now , it was all idiot , cub , and run me through the guts .
Damn Your way of fighting , I say .
After we take a knock in this part of the country , we kiss and be friends .
But if you had run me through the guts , then I should be dead , and you might go kiss the hangman .
Hastings . The rebuke is just .
But I must hasten to relieve Miss
Neville : if you keep the old lady employed , I promise to take care of the young one . [ Exit Hastings .
] Tony . Never fear me .
Here she comes .
Vanish .
Mrs . Hardcastle . Oh , Tony , I_ _m killed ! Shook ! Battered to death .
I shall never survive it .
That last jolt , that laid us against the quickset hedge , has done my business .
Tony .
Alack , mamma , it was all your own fault .
You would be for running away by night , without knowing one inch of the way .
Mrs . Hardcastle . I wish we were at home again .
I never met so many accidents in so short a journey .
Drenched in the mud , overturned in a ditch , stuck fast in a slough , jolted to a jelly , and at=last to lose our way .
Whereabouts do you think we are , Tony ?
Tony .
By my guess we should come upon Crackskull=Common , about forty miles from home .
Mrs . Hardcastle . O lud !
O lud ! The most notorious spot in all the country .
We only want a robbery to make a complete night on't . Tony .
Do_ _n't be afraid , mamma , do_ _n't be afraid .
Two of the five that kept here are hanged , and the other three may not find us .
Do_ _n't be afraid .
-- Is that a man that_ _s galloping behind us ?
No ; it_ _s only a tree .
-- Do_ _n't be afraid .
Mrs . Hardcastle . The fright will certainly kill me .
Tony . Do you see anything like a black hat moving behind the thicket ?
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Oh , death !
No ; it_ _s only a cow .
Do_ _n't be afraid , mamma ;
do_ _n't be afraid . Mrs .
Hardcastle .
As I'm alive , Tony , I see a man coming towards us .
Ah ! I_ _m sure on't .
If he perceives us , we are undone . Tony . ( Aside . ) Father-in-law , by all that_ _s unlucky , come to take one of his night walks . ( To her . ) Ah , it_ _s a highwayman with pistols as long as my arm. A damned ill-looking fellow .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Good Heaven defend us !
He approaches . Tony .
Do you hide yourself in that thicket , and leave me to manage him .
If there be any danger , I_ _ll cough , and cry hem .
When I cough , be sure to keep close . ( Mrs .
Hardcastle .
I_ _m mistaken , or I heard voices of people in want of help . Oh , Tony ! is that you ?
I did not expect you so soon back .
Are your mother and her charge in safety ? Tony .
Very safe , sir , at my aunt Pedigree's . Hem .
Mrs . Hardcastle . ( From behind .
) Ah , death !
I find there_ _s danger . Hardcastle .
Forty miles in three hours ;
sure that_ _s too much , my youngster .
Tony . Stout horses and willing minds make short journeys , as they say .
Hem .
Mrs . Hardcastle . ( From behind . ) Sure he_ _ll do the dear boy no harm . Hardcastle .
But I heard a voice here ;
I should be glad to know from whence it came .
Tony . It was I , sir , talking to myself , sir . I was saying that forty miles in four hours was very good going .
Hem .
As=to be sure it was .
Hem .
I have got a sort of cold by being out in the air .
We_ _ll go in , if you please .
Hem .
Hardcastle .
But if you talked to yourself you did not answer yourself .
I_ _m certain I heard two voices , and am resolved ( raising his voice ) to find the other out .
Mrs .
Hardcastle . ( From behind . ) Oh !
he_ _s coming to find me out .
Oh !
Tony .
Hem .
Hardcastle . I tell you I will not be detained .
I insist on seeing . It_ _s in vain to expect I_ _ll believe you . Mrs .
Hardcastle . ( Running forward from behind . ) O lud !
he_ _ll murder my poor boy , my darling !
Here , good gentleman , whet your rage upon me .
Take my money , my life , but spare that young gentleman ;
spare my child , if you have any mercy .
Hardcastle . My wife , as I_ _m a Christian .
From whence can she come ?
or what does she mean ? Mrs .
Take our money , our watches , all we have , but spare our lives . We will never bring you to justice ;
indeed we will_ _n't , good Mr. Highwayman . Hardcastle .
I believe the woman's out=of her senses . What , Dorothy , do_ _n't you know Me ?
Mrs .
Hardcastle .
Mr.=Hardcastle , as I_ _m alive !
My fears blinded me .
But who , my dear , could have expected to meet you here , in this frightful place , so=far from home ?
What has brought you to follow us ?
Hardcastle .
Sure , Dorothy , you have not lost your wits ?
So=far from home , when you are within forty yards of your own door ! ( To him .
) This is one of your old tricks , you graceless rogue , you . ( To her .
) Do_ _n't you know the gate , and the mulberry-tree ;
and do_ _n't you remember the horse-pond , my dear ? Mrs .
Hardcastle . Yes , I shall remember the horse-pond as=long=as I live ;
I have caught my death in it . ( To Tony .
) And it is to you , you graceless varlet , I owe all this ?
I_ _ll teach you to abuse your mother , I will . Tony .
Ecod , mother , all the parish says you have spoiled me , and so you may take the fruits on't .
Mrs . Hardcastle .
I_ _ll spoil you , I will . [ Follows him off the stage . Exit .
Enter Hastings and Miss=neville . Hastings . My dear Constance , why will you deliberate thus ?
If we delay a moment , all is lost for=ever .
Pluck up a little resolution , and we shall soon be out=of the reach of her malignity .
Miss=neville . I find it impossible .
My spirits are so sunk with the agitations I have suffered , that I am unable to face any new danger .
Two or three years' patience will at=last crown us with happiness .
Hastings . Such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy .
Let us fly , my charmer .
Let us date our happiness from this very moment .
Perish fortune !
Love and content will increase what we possess beyond a monarch's revenue . Let me prevail !
Miss=neville .
No , Mr.=Hastings , no. Prudence once=more comes to my relief , and I will obey its dictates .
In the moment of passion fortune may be despised , but it ever produces a lasting repentance .
I_ _m resolved to apply to Mr.=Hardcastle's compassion and justice for redress .
Hastings . But though he had the will , he has not the power to relieve you .
Miss=neville . But he has influence , and upon that I am resolved to rely .
Hastings . I have no hopes .
Scene changes . Enter Sir=charles and Miss=hardcastle . Sir=charles . What a situation am I in !
If what you say appears , I shall then find a guilty son .
If what he says be true , I shall then lose one that , of all others , I most wished-for a daughter .
Miss=hardcastle . I am proud of your approbation , and to show I merit it , if you place yourselves as I directed , you shall hear his explicit declaration .
But he comes .
Enter Marlow . Marlow . Though prepared for setting out , I come once=more to take leave ;
nor did I , till this moment , know the pain I feel in the separation .
Miss=hardcastle . ( In her own natural manner . ) I believe sufferings can_ _not be very great , sir , which you can so easily remove .
A day or two longer , perhaps , might lessen your uneasiness , by showing the little value of what you now think proper to regret . Marlow . ( Aside .
) This girl every moment improves upon me . ( To her .
) It must not be , madam .
I have already trifled too long with my heart .
My very pride begins to submit to my passion .
The disparity of education and fortune , the anger of a parent , and the contempt of my equals , begin to lose their weight ; and nothing can restore me to myself but this painful effort of resolution .
Miss=hardcastle .
Then go , sir : I_ _ll urge nothing more to detain you .
Though my family be as good as hers you came down to visit , and my education , I hope , not inferior , what are these advantages without equal affluence ?
I must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit ;
I must have only the mockery of your addresses , while all your serious aims are fixed on fortune .
Here , behind this screen . Hardcastle . Ay , ay ;
make no noise . I_ _ll engage my Kate covers him with confusion at=last . Marlow .
By heavens , madam ! fortune was ever my smallest consideration . Your beauty at=first caught my eye ;
for who could see that without emotion ?
But every moment that I converse with you steals in some new grace , heightens the picture , and gives it stronger expression .
What at=first seemed rustic plainness , now appears refined simplicity .
What seemed forward assurance , now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence and conscious virtue .
Sir=charles . What can it mean ?
He amazes me !
Hardcastle . I told you how it would be . Hush !
Marlow .
I am now determined to stay , madam ;
and I have too good an opinion of my father's discernment , when he sees you , to doubt his approbation .
Miss=hardcastle . No , Mr.=Marlow , I will not , can_ _not detain you .
Do you think I could suffer a connexion in which there is the smallest room for repentance ?
Do you think I would take the mean advantage of a transient passion , to load you with confusion ?
Do you think I could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours ?
Marlow .
By all that_ _s good , I can have no happiness but what's in your power to grant me !
Nor shall I ever feel repentance but in not having seen your merits before .
I will stay even contrary=to your wishes ;
and though you should persist to shun me , I will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct .
Miss=hardcastle . Sir , I must entreat you_ _ll desist .
As our acquaintance began , so let it end , in indifference .
I might have given an hour or two to levity ; but seriously , Mr.=Marlow , do you think I could ever submit to a connexion where I must appear mercenary , and you imprudent ?
Do you think I could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer ?
Marlow . ( Kneeling . ) Does this look like security ?
Does this look like confidence ?
No , madam , every moment that shows me your merit , only serves to increase my diffidence and confusion .
Here let me continue ----
Sir=charles .
I can hold it no=longer .
Charles , Charles , how hast thou deceived me !
Is this your indifference , your uninteresting conversation ?
Hardcastle . Your cold contempt ;
your formal interview !
What have you to say now ? Marlow . That I'm all amazement !
What can it mean ?
Hardcastle . It means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure : that you can address a lady in private , and deny it in public : that you have one story for us , and another for my daughter .
Marlow . Daughter !
-- This lady your daughter ?
Hardcastle . Yes , sir , my only daughter ; my Kate ;
whose else should she be ?
Marlow .
Oh , the devil !
Miss=hardcastle . Yes , sir , that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for ( courtseying ) ;
she that you addressed as the mild , modest , sentimental man of gravity , and the bold , forward , agreeable Rattle of the Ladies' Club .
Ha !
ha !
ha !
Marlow .
Zounds !
there_ _s no bearing this ;
it_ _s worse than death !
Miss=hardcastle . In which of your characters , sir , will you give us leave to address you ?
As the faltering gentleman , with looks on the ground , that speaks just to be heard , and hates hypocrisy ;
or the loud confident creature , that keeps it up with Mrs.=Mantrap , and old Miss Biddy=Buckskin , till three in the morning ?
Ha !
ha !
ha !
Marlow .
O , curse on my noisy head .
I never attempted to be impudent yet , that I was not taken down . I must be gone .
Hardcastle .
By the hand of my body , but you shall not .
I see it was all a mistake , and I am rejoiced to find it .
You shall not , sir , I tell you .
I know she_ _ll forgive you .
Will_ _n't you forgive him , Kate ?
We_ _ll all forgive you .
Hardcastle .
So , so , they_ _re gone off . Let them go , I care not .
Hardcastle . Who gone ?
Mrs .
Hardcastle . My dutiful niece and her gentleman , Mr.=Hastings , from town .
He who came down with our modest visitor here .
Sir=charles .
Who , my honest George=Hastings ?
As worthy a fellow as lives , and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice .
Hardcastle . Then , by the hand of my body , I_ _m proud of the connexion . Mrs .
Hardcastle . Well , if he has taken away the lady , he has not taken her fortune ;
that remains in this family to console us for her loss .
Hardcastle . Sure , Dorothy , you would not be so mercenary ?
Mrs . Hardcastle .
Ay , that_ _s my affair , not yours .
Hardcastle . Ay , but he_ _s not of age , and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal .
Enter Hastings and Miss=neville . Mrs .
Hardcastle . ( Aside .
) What , returned so soon ! I begin not to like it .
Hastings . ( To Hardcastle . ) For my late attempt to fly off with your niece let my present confusion be my punishment .
We are now come back , to appeal from your justice to your humanity .
By her father's consent , I first paid her my addresses , and our passions were first founded in duty .
Miss=neville . Since his death , I have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression .
In an hour of levity , I was ready to give up my fortune to secure my choice .
But I am now recovered from the delusion , and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connexion .
Mrs . Hardcastle . Pshaw , pshaw !
this is all=but the whining end of a modern novel .
Hardcastle . Be it what it will , I_ _m glad they_ _re come back to reclaim their due .
Come hither , Tony , boy .
What signifies my refusing ?
While I thought concealing your age , boy , was likely to conduce to your improvement , I concurred with your mother's desire to keep it secret .
Of age ! Am=I of age , father ?
Hardcastle . Above three months .
Tony .
Then you_ _ll see the first use I_ _ll make of my liberty . ( Taking MISS=NEVILLE's hand .
) Witness all men by these presents , that I , Anthony=Lumpkin , Esquire , of Blank place , refuse you , Constantia Neville , spinster , of no place at=all , for my true and lawful wife .
So Constance=Neville may marry whom she pleases , and Tony=Lumpkin is his own man again .
Sir=charles .
O brave ' squire !
Hastings .
My worthy friend !
Mrs . Hardcastle .
My undutiful offspring !
Marlow .
Joy , my dear George !
I give you joy sincerely .
And could I prevail upon my little tyrant here to be less arbitrary , I should be the happiest man alive , if you would return me the favour .
Hastings . ( To Miss=hardcastle . ) Come , madam , you are now driven to the very last scene of all your contrivances .
I know you like him , I_ _m sure he loves you , and you must and shall have him .
Hardcastle . ( Joining their hands . ) And=I say so too .
So now to supper .
To-morrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us , and the mistakes of the night shall be crowned with a merry morning .
So , boy , take her ; and as you have been mistaken in the mistress , my wish is , that you may never be mistaken in the wife .
