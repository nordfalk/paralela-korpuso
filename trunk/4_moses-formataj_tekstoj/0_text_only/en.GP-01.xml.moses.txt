Act The First .
Scene I .
A Grove before the Temple=of=Diana .
Iphigenia .
Beneath your leafy gloom , ye waving boughs Of this old , shady , consecrated grove , As=in the goddess' silent sanctuary , With the same shudd'ring feeling forth I step , As when I trod it first , nor ever here .
h my unquiet spirit feel at-home .
Long as the mighty will , to which I bow , Hath kept me here conceal'd , still , as at=first , I feel myself a stranger .
For the sea .
h sever me , alas !
from those I love , And day=by=day upon the shore I stand , My soul still seeking for the land of Greece .
But to my sighs , the hollow-sounding waves Bring , save their own hoarse murmurs , no reply . Alas for him !
who friendless and alone , Remote from parents and from brethren dwells ;
From him grief snatches every coming joy Ere it doth reach his lip .
His restless thoughts Revert for=ever to his father's halls , Where first to him the radiant sun unclos'd The gates of heav'n ;
where closer , day=by=day , Brothers and sisters , leagu'd in pastime sweet , Around each=other twin'd the bonds of love . I will not judge the counsel of the gods ;
Yet , truly , woman's lot doth merit pity .
Man rules alike at home and in the field , Nor is in foreign climes without resource ;
Possession gladdens him , him conquest crowns , And him an honourable death awaits .
How circumscrib'd is woman's destiny !
Obedience to a harsh , imperious lord , Her duty , and her comfort ;
sad her fate , Whom hostile fortune drives to lands remote : Thus I , by noble Thoas , am detain'd , Bound with a heavy , though a sacred chain . Oh !
with what shame , Diana , I confess That with repugnance I perform these rites For thee , divine protectress !
unto whom I would in freedom dedicate my life . In thee , Diana , I have always hop'd , And still I hope in thee , who didst infold Within the holy shelter of thine arm The outcast daughter of the mighty king .
Daughter=of=Jove !
hast thou from ruin'd Troy Led back in triumph to his native land The mighty man , whom thou didst sore afflict , His daughter's life in sacrifice demanding , -- Hast thou for him , the godlike Agamemnon , Who to thine altar led his darling child , Preserv'd his wife , Electra , and his son .
Scene II .
Iphigenia .
Arkas .
Arkas .
The king hath sent me hither , and commands To hail Diana's priestess .
This the day , On which for new and wonderful success , Tauris her goddess thanks .
The king and host Draw near , -- I come to herald their approach .
Iphigenia .
We are prepar'd to give them worthy greeting ; Our goddess doth behold with gracious eye The welcome sacrifice from Thoas' hand .
Arkas .
Oh , priestess , that thine eye more mildly beam'd , -- Thou much-rever'd one , -- that I found thy glance , O consecrated maid , more calm , more bright , To all a happy omen !
Still doth grief , With gloom mysterious , shroud thy inner mind ;
Still , still , through many a year we wait in vain For one confiding utt'rance from thy breast .
Long as I_ _ve known thee in this holy place , That look of thine hath ever made me shudder ;
And , as with iron bands , thy soul remains Lock'd in the deep recesses of thy breast .
Iphigenia .
As doth become the exile and the orphan .
Arkas .
Dost thou then here seem exil'd and an orphan ?
Iphigenia .
Can foreign scenes our fatherland replace ?
Arkas .
Thy fatherland is foreign now to thee .
Iphigenia .
Hence is it that my bleeding heart ne'er heals .
In early youth , when first my soul , in=love , Held father , mother , brethren fondly twin'd , A group of tender germs , in union sweet , We sprang in beauty from the parent stem , And heavenward grew .
An unrelenting curse Then seiz'd and sever'd me from those I lov'd , And wrench'd with iron grasp the beauteous bands .
It vanish'd then , the fairest charm of youth , The simple gladness of life's early dawn ;
Though sav'd , I was a shadow of myself , And life's fresh joyance bloom'd in me no=more .
Arkas .
If thus thou ever dost lament thy fate , I must accuse thee of ingratitude .
Iphigenia .
Thanks have you ever .
Arkas .
Not the honest thanks Which prompt the heart to offices of love ; The joyous glance , revealing to the host A grateful spirit , with its lot content .
When thee a deep mysterious destiny Brought to this sacred fane , long years ago . To greet thee , as a treasure sent from heaven , With reverence and affection , Thoas came .
Benign and friendly was this shore to thee , Which had before each stranger's heart appall'd , For , till thy coming , none e'er trod our realm But fell , according=to an ancient rite , A bloody victim at Diana's shrine .
Iphigenia .
Freely to breathe alone is not to live .
Say , is it life , within this holy fane , Like a poor ghost around its sepulchre To linger out my days ?
Or call you that A life of conscious happiness and joy , When every hour , dream'd listlessly away , Leads to those dark and melancholy days , Which the sad troop of the departed spend In self-forgetfulness on Lethe_ _s shore ?
A useless life is but an early death ;
This , woman's lot , is eminently mine .
Arkas .
I can forgive , though I must needs deplore , The noble pride which underrates itself It robs thee of the happiness of life .
And hast thou , since thy coming here , done nought ?
Who cheer'd the gloomy temper of the king ?
Who hath with gentle eloquence annull'd , From year to year , the usage of our sires , By which , a victim at Diana's shrine , Each stranger perish'd , thus from certain death Sending so oft the rescued captive home ?
Hath not Diana , harbouring no revenge For this suspension of her bloody rites , In richest measure heard thy gentle prayer ?
On joyous pinions o'er the advancing host , .
h not triumphant conquest proudly soar ?
Thou , Thou , from whose being o'er a thousand hearts , A healing balsam flows ?
when to a race . To whom a god consign'd thee , thou dost prove A fountain of perpetual happiness , And from this dire inhospitable shore Dost to the stranger grant a safe return ?
Iphigenia .
The little done doth vanish to the mind , Which forward sees how much remains to do .
Arkas .
Him dost thou praise , who underrates his deeds ?
Iphigenia .
Who estimates his deeds is justly blam'd .
Arkas .
We blame alike , who proudly disregard Their genuine merit , and who vainly prize Their spurious worth too highly .
Trust me , priestess , And hearken to the counsel of a man With honest zeal devoted to thy service : When Thoas comes to-day to speak with thee , Lend to his purpos'd words a gracious ear .
Iphigenia .
The well-intention'd counsel troubles me : His offer studiously I_ _ve sought to shun .
Arkas .
Thy duty and thy interest calmly weigh .
Since the king lost his son , he trusts but few , Nor those as formerly .
Each noble's son He views with jealous eye as his successor ; He dreads a solitary , helpless age , Or rash rebellion , or untimely death .
A Scythian studies not the rules of speech , And least=of=all the king .
He who is used To act and to command , knows not the art , From far , with subtle tact , to guide discourse Through many windings to its destin'd goal .
Do not embarrass him with shy reserve And studied misconception : graciously , And with submission , meet the royal wish .
Iphigenia .
Shall I then speed the doom that threatens me ?
Arkas .
His gracious offer canst thou call a threat ?
Iphigenia .
' Tis the most terrible of all to me .
Arkas .
For his affection grant him confidence .
Iphigenia .
If he will first redeem my soul from fear .
Arkas .
Why dost thou hide from him thy origin ?
Iphigenia .
A priestess secrecy doth well become .
Arkas .
Nought to our monarch should a secret be ;
And , though he doth not seek to fathom thine , His noble nature feels , ay , deeply feels , That studiously thou hid'st thyself from him .
Iphigenia .
Displeasure doth he harbour ' gainst me , then ?
Arkas .
Almost it seems so .
True , he speaks not of thee . But casual words have taught me that the wish To call thee his hath firmly seiz'd his soul ;
Oh , do not leave the monarch to himself ! Lest his displeasure , rip'ning in his breast , Should work thee woe , so with repentance thou Too late my faithful counsel shalt recall .
Iphigenia .
How ! doth the monarch purpose what no man Of noble mind , who loves his honest name , Whose bosom reverence for the gods restrains , Would ever think of ?
Will he force employ To tear me from this consecrated fane ?
Then will I call the gods , and chiefly thee , Diana , goddess resolute , to aid me ; Thyself a virgin , thou'lt a virgin shield , And succour to thy priestess gladly yield .
Arkas .
Be tranquil !
Passion , and youth's fiery blood Impel not Thoas rashly to commit A deed so lawless .
In his present mood , I fear from him another harsh resolve , Which ( for his soul is steadfast and unmov'd , ) He then will execute without delay .
Therefore I pray thee , canst thou grant no=more , At=least be grateful -- give thy confidence .
Iphigenia .
Oh tell me what is further known to thee .
Arkas .
Learn it from him .
I see the king approach ;
Thou honour'st him , and thy own heart will prompt thee To meet him kindly and with confidence .
A noble man by woman's gentle word May oft be led .
Iphigenia , _alone_ .
I see not how I can Follow the counsel of my faithful friend .
But willingly the duty I perform Of giving thanks for benefits receiv'd , And much I wish that to the king my lips With truth could utter what would please his ear .
Scene III .
Iphigenia .
Thoas .
Iphigenia .
Her royal gifts the goddess shower on thee !
Imparting conquest , wealth , and high renown , Dominion , and the welfare of thy house , With the fulfilment of each pious wish , That thou , who over numbers rul'st supreme , Thyself may'st be supreme in happiness !
Thoas .
Contented were I with my people's praise ; My conquests others more=than I enjoy .
Oh ! be he king or subject , he_ _s most blest , Who in his home finds happiness and peace .
Thou shar'dst my sorrow , when a hostile sword Tore from my side my last , my dearest son ;
Long as fierce vengeance occupied my heart , I did not feel my dwelling's dreary void ;
But now , returning home , my rage appeas'd , My foes defeated , and my son aveng'd , I find there nothing left to comfort me .
The glad obedience , which I used to see Kindling in every eye , is smother'd now In discontent and gloom ;
each , pond'ring , weighs The changes which a future day may bring , And serves the childless king , because compell'd .
To-day I come within this sacred fane , Which I have often enter'd to implore And thank the gods for conquest .
In my breast I bear an old and fondly-cherish'd wish .
To which methinks thou canst not be a stranger ;
Thee , maid , a blessing to myself and realm , I hope , as bride , to carry to my home . Iphigenia .
Too great thine offer , king , to one unknown ;
Abash'd the fugitive before thee stands , Who on this shore sought only what thou gav'st , Safety and peace .
Thoas .
Thus still to shroud thyself From me , as=from the lowest , in the veil Of mystery which wrapp'd thy coming here , Would in no country be deem'd just or right .
Strangers this shore appall'd ; _t_ _was so ordain'd Alike by law and stern necessity .
From thee alone -- a kindly welcom'd guest , Who hast enjoy'd each hallow'd privilege , And spent thy days in freedom unrestrain'd -- From thee I hop'd that confidence to gain Which every faithful host may justly claim .
Iphigenia .
If I conceal'd , O king , my name , my race , ' Twas fear that prompted me , and not mistrust .
For didst thou know who stands before thee now , And what accursed head thy arm protects , A shudd'ring horror would possess thy heart ;
And , far from wishing me to share thy throne , Thou , ere the time appointed , from thy realm Wouldst banish me perchance , and thrust me forth , Before a glad reunion with my friends And period to my wand'rings is ordain'd , To meet that sorrow , which in every clime , With cold , inhospitable , fearful hand , Awaits the outcast , exil'd from his home .
Thoas .
Whate'er respecting thee the gods decree , Whate'er their doom for thee and for thy house , Since thou hast dwelt amongst us , and enjoy'd The privilege the pious stranger claims , To me hath fail'd no blessing sent from Heaven ;
And to persuade me , that protecting thee I shield a guilty head , were hard indeed .
Iphigenia .
Thy bounty , not the guest , draws blessings down .
Thoas .
The kindness shown the wicked is not blest .
End then thy silence , priestess ; not unjust Is he who doth demand it .
In my hands The goddess plac'd thee ;
thou hast been to me As sacred as=to her , and her behest Shall for the future also be my law .
If thou canst hope in safety to return Back to thy kindred , I renounce my claims : But is thy homeward path for=ever clos'd -- Or doth thy race in hopeless exile rove , Or lie extinguish'd by some mighty woe -- Then may I claim thee by more laws than one .
Speak openly , thou know'st I keep my word .
Iphigenia .
Its ancient bands reluctantly my tongue . h loose , a long-hid secret to divulge ;
For once imparted , it resumes no=more The safe asylum of the inmost heart , But thenceforth , as the powers above decree , . h work its ministry of weal or woe .
Attend !
I issue from the Titan's race .
Thoas .
A word momentous calmly hast thou spoken .
Him nam'st thou ancestor whom all the world Knows as a sometime favourite of the gods ? Is it that Tantalus , whom Jove himself Drew to his council and his social board ?
On whose experienc'd words , with wisdom fraught , As on the language of an oracle , E'en gods delighted hung ?
Iphigenia .
' Tis even he ;
But gods should not hold intercourse with men As with themselves . Too weak the human race , Not to grow dizzy on unwonted heights .
Ignoble was he not , and no betrayer ; To be the Thunderer's slave , he was too great : To be his friend and comrade , -- but a man .
Alas , and his whole race their hate pursues .
Thoas .
Bear they their own guilt , or their ancestors' ?
Iphigenia .
The Titan's mighty breast and nervous frame Was his descendant's certain heritage ;
But round their brow Jove forg'd a band of brass .
Wisdom and patience , prudence and restraint , He from their gloomy , fearful eye conceal'd ;
In them each passion grew to savage rage , And headlong rush'd uncheck'd .
The Titan's son , The strong-will'd Pelops , won his beauteous bride , Hippodamia , child of OEnomaus , Through treachery and murder ;
she ere long Bore him two children , Atreus and Thyestes ;
With envy they beheld the growing love Their father cherish'd for a first-born son Sprung from another union .
Bound by hate , In secret they contrive their brother's death .
The sire , the crime imputing to his wife , With savage fury claim'd from her his child , And she in terror did destroy herself --
Thoas .
Thou'rt silent ?
Pause not in thy narrative !
Do not repent thy confidence -- say on !
Iphigenia .
How blest is he who his progenitors With pride remembers , to the list'ner tells The story of their greatness , of their deeds , And , silently rejoicing , sees himself Link'd to this goodly chain !
For the same stock Bears not the monster and the demigod : A line , or good or evil , ushers in The glory or the terror of the world .
-- After the death of Pelops , his two sons Rul'd o'er the city with divided sway .
But such an union could not long endure .
His brother's honour first Thyestes wounds .
In vengeance Atreus drove him from the realm .
Thyestes , planning horrors , long=before Had stealthily procur'd his brother's son , Whom he in secret nurtur'd as his own .
Revenge and fury in his breast he pour'd , Then to the royal city sent him forth , That in his uncle he might slay his sire , The meditated murder was disclos'd , And by the king most cruelly aveng'd , Who slaughter'd , as he thought , his brother's son .
Too late he learn'd whose dying tortures met His drunken gaze ;
and seeking to assuage The insatiate vengeance that possess'd his soul , He plann'd a deed unheard of .
He assum'd A friendly tone , seem'd reconcil'd , appeas'd . And lur'd his brother , with his children twain , Back to his kingdom ;
these he seiz'd and slew ;
Then plac'd the loathsome and abhorrent food At his first meal before the unconscious sire .
And when Thyestes had his hunger still'd With his own flesh , a sadness seiz'd his soul ;
He for his children ask'd , -- their steps , their voice , Fancied he heard already at the door ;
And Atreus , grinning with malicious joy , Threw in the members of the slaughter'd boys .
-- Shudd'ring , O king , thou dost avert thy face : So did the sun his radiant visage hide , And swerve his chariot from the eternal path .
These , monarch , are thy priestess' ancestors , And many a dreadful fate of mortal doom , And many a deed of the bewilder'd brain , Dark night doth cover with her sable wing , Or shroud in gloomy twilight .
Thoas .
Hidden there Let them abide .
A truce to horror now , And tell me by what miracle thou sprang'st From race so savage .
Iphigenia .
Atreus' eldest son Was Agamemnon ;
he , O king , my sire : But I may say with truth , that , from a child , In him the model of a perfect man I witness'd ever .
Clytemnestra bore To him , myself , the firstling of their love , Electra then .
Peaceful the monarch rul'd , And to the house of Tantalus was given A long-withheld repose .
A son alone Was wanting to complete my parent's bliss ;
Scarce was this wish fulfill'd , and young Orestes , The household's darling , with his sisters grew , When new misfortunes vex'd our ancient house .
To you hath come the rumour of the war , Which , to avenge the fairest woman's wrongs , The force united of the Grecian kings Round Ilion's walls encamp'd .
Whether the town Was humbl'd , and achiev'd their great revenge I have not heard .
My father led the host In Aulis vainly for a favouring gale They waited ;
for , enrag'd against their chief , Diana stay'd their progress , and requir'd , Through Chaleas' voice , the monarch's eldest daughter .
They lur'd me with my mother to the camp , And at Diana's altar doom'd this head .
-- She was appeas'd , she did not wish my blood , And wrapt me in a soft protecting cloud ;
Within this temple from the dream of death I waken'd first .
Yes , I myself am she ; Iphigenia , -- I who speak to thee Am=Atreus' grandchild , Agamemnon's child , And great Diana's consecrated priestess .
Thoas .
I yield no higher honour or regard To the king's daughter than the maid unknown ;
Once=more my first proposal I repeat ; Come , follow me , and share what I possess .
Iphigenia .
How dare I venture such a step , O king ?
Hath not the goddess who protected me Alone a right to my devoted head ?
' Twas she who chose for me this sanctuary , Where she perchance reserves me for my sire , By my apparent death enough chastis'd , To be the joy and solace of his age .
Perchance my glad return is near ;
and how If I , unmindful of her purposes , Had here attach'd myself against her will ?
I ask'd a signal , did she wish my stay .
Thoas .
The signal is that still thou tarriest here .
Seek not evasively such vain pretexts .
Not=many words are needed to refuse , By the refus'd the _no_ alone is heard .
Iphigenia .
Mine are not words meant only to deceive ;
I have to thee my inmost heart reveal'd .
And doth no inward voice suggest to thee , How I with yearning soul must pine to see My father , mother , and my long-lost home ?
Oh let thy vessels bear me thither , king !
That in the ancient halls , where sorrow still In accents low doth fondly breathe my name , Joy , as=in welcome of a new-born child , May round the columns twine the fairest wreath . Thou wouldst to me and mine new life impart . Thoas .
Then go !
the promptings of thy heart obey ; Despise the voice of reason and good counsel .
Be quite the woman , sway'd by each desire , That bridleless impels her to=and=fro .
When passion rages fiercely in her breast , No sacred tie withholds her from the wretch Who would allure her to forsake for him A husband's or a father's guardian arms ;
Extinct within her heart its fiery glow , The golden tongue of eloquence in vain With words of truth and power assails her ear .
Iphigenia .
Remember now , O king , thy noble words !
My trust and candour wilt thou thus repay ?
Thou seem'dst , methought , prepar'd to hear the truth .
Thoas .
For this unlook'd-for answer not prepar'd .
Yet _t_ _was to be expected ; knew I not That _t_ _was with woman I had now to deal ?
Iphigenia .
Upbraid not thus , O king , our feeble sex !
Though not in dignity to match with yours , The weapons woman wields are not ignoble .
And trust me , Thoas , in thy happiness I have a deeper insight than thyself .
Thou thinkest , ignorant alike of both , A closer union would augment our bliss ;
Inspir'd with confidence and honest zeal Thou strongly urgest me to yield consent ;
And here I thank the gods , who give me strength To shun a doom unratified by them .
Thoas .
' Tis not a god , _t_ _is thine own heart that speaks .
Iphigenia .
' Tis through the heart alone they speak to us .
Thoas .
To hear them have I not an equal right ?
Iphigenia .
The raging tempest drowns the still , small voice .
Thoas .
This voice no doubt the priestess hears alone .
Iphigenia .
Before all others should the prince attend it .
Thoas .
Thy sacred office , and ancestral right To Jove's own table , place thee with the gods In closer union than an earth-born savage .
Iphigenia .
Thus must I now the confidence atone Thyself extorted from me !
Thoas .
I_ _m a man , And better _t_ _is we end this conference .
Hear then my last resolve .
Be priestess still Of the great goddess who selected thee ;
And may she pardon me , that I from her , Unjustly and with secret self-reproach , Her ancient sacrifice so long withheld .
From olden times no stranger near'd our shore But fell a victim at her sacred shrine .
But thou , with kind affection ( which at times Seem'd like a gentle daughter's tender love , At times assum'd to my enraptur'd heart The modest inclination of a bride ) , Didst so inthral me , as with magic bonds , That I forgot my duty .
Thou didst rock My senses in a dream : I did not hear My people's murmurs : now they cry aloud , Ascribing my poor son's untimely death To this my guilt .
No=longer for thy sake Will I oppose the wishes of the crowd , Who urgently demand the sacrifice .
Iphigenia .
For mine own sake I ne'er desired it from thee .
Who to the gods ascribe a thirst for blood Do misconceive their nature , and impute To them their own inhuman dark desires .
Did not Diana snatch me from the priest , Preferring my poor service to my death ?
Thoas .
' Tis not for us , on reason's shifting grounds , Lightly to guide and construe rites divine .
Perform thy duty ; I_ _ll accomplish mine .
Two strangers , whom in caverns of the shore We found conceal'd , and whose arrival here Bodes to my realm no-good , are in my power .
With them thy goddess may once=more resume Her ancient , pious , long-suspended rites !
I send them here , -- thy duty not unknown . [ _Exit . _
Iphigenia , _alone_ .
Gracious protectress ! thou hast clouds To shelter innocence distress'd , And genial gales from Fate's rude grasp , Safely to waft her o'er the sea , O'er the wide earth's remotest realms , Where'er it seemeth good to thee .
Wise art thou , -- thine all-seeing eye The future and the past surveys , And doth on all thy children rest , E'en as thy pure and guardian light Keeps o'er the earth its silent watch , The beauty and the life of night . O Goddess !
keep my hands from blood !
Blessing it never brings , nor peace ;
And still in evil hours the form Of the chance-murder'd man appears To fill the unwilling murderer's soul With horrible and gloomy fears . For fondly the Immortals view Man's widely-scatter'd , simple race ;
And the poor mortal's transient life Gladly prolong , that he may raise Awhile to their eternal heavens His sympathetic joyous gaze .
Act The Second .
Scene I .
Orestes .
Pylades .
Orestes .
It is the path of death that now we tread : At every step my soul grows more serene .
When I implor'd Apollo to remove The grisly band of Furies from my side , He seem'd , with hope-inspiring , godlike words , To promise aid and safety in the fane Of his lov'd sister , who o'er Tauris rules .
Thus the prophetic word fulfils itself , That with my life shall terminate my woe .
How easy _t_ _is for me , whose heart is crush'd , Whose sense is deaden'd by a hand divine , Thus to renounce the beauteous light of day !
And must the son of Atreus not entwine The wreath of conquest round his dying brow -- Must I , as my forefathers , as my sire , Bleed like a victim , -- an ignoble death -- So be it !
Better at the altar here , Than in a nook obscure , where kindred hands Have spread assassination's wily net .
Yield me this brief repose , infernal Powers ! Ye , who , like loosen'd hounds , still scent the blood , Which , trickling from my feet , betrays my path . Leave me !
ere long I come to you below . Nor you , nor I , should view the light of day .
The soft green carpet of the beauteous earth Is no arena for unhallow'd fiends .
Below I seek you , where an equal fate Binds all in murky , never-ending night .
Thee only , thee , my Pylades , my friend , The guiltless partner of my crime and curse , Thee am I loath , before thy time , to take To yonder cheerless shore !
Thy life or death Alone awakens in me hope or fear .
Pylades .
Like thee , Orestes , I am not prepar'd Downwards to wander to yon realm of shade .
I purpose still , through the entangl'd paths , Which seem as they would lead to blackest night , Again to guide our upward way to life .
Of death I think not ;
I observe and mark Whether the gods may not perchance present Means and fit moment for a joyful flight .
Dreaded or not , the stroke of death must come ;
And though the priestess stood with hand uprais'd , Prepar'd to cut our consecrated locks , Our safety still should be my only thought : Uplift thy soul above this weak despair ;
Desponding doubts but hasten on our peril .
Apollo pledg'd to us his sacred word , That in his sister's' holy fane for thee Were comfort , aid , and glad return prepar'd .
The words of Heaven are not equivocal , As=in despair the poor oppress'd one thinks .
Orestes .
The mystic web of life my mother spread Around my infant head , and so I grew , An image of my sire ; and my mute look Was aye a bitter and a keen reproof To her and base Ægisthus [ 1 ] .
Oh , how oft , When silently within our gloomy hall Electra sat , and mus'd beside the fire , Have I with anguish'd spirit climb'd her knee , And watch'd her bitter tears with sad amaze !
Then would she tell me of our noble sire : How much I long'd to see him -- be with him !
Myself at Troy one moment fondly wish'd , My sire's return , the next .
The day arrived --
( Transcriber's Note 1 : Original text read « Egisthus » . ) Pylades .
Oh , of that awful hour let fiends of hell Hold nightly converse !
Of a time more fair May the remembrance animate our hearts To fresh heroic deeds .
The gods require On this wide earth the service of the good , To work their pleasure .
Still they count on thee ;
For in thy father's train they sent thee not , When he to Orcus went unwilling down .
Orestes .
Would I had seiz'd the border of his robe . And follow'd him !
Pylades .
They kindly car'd for me Who here detain'd thee ;
for if thou hadst died I know not what had then become of me ; Since I with thee , and for thy sake alone , Have from my childhood liv'd , and wish to live .
Orestes .
Do not remind me of those tranquil days , When me thy home a safe asylum gave ; With fond solicitude thy noble sire The half-nipp'd , tender flow'ret gently rear'd ; While thou , a friend and playmate always gay , Like to a light and brilliant butterfly Around a dusky flower , didst around me Still with new life thy merry gambols play , And breathe thy joyous spirit in my soul , Until , my cares forgetting , I with thee Was lur'd to snatch the eager joys of youth .
Pylades .
My very life began when thee I lov'd .
Orestes .
Say , then thy woes began , and thou speak'st truly .
This is the sharpest sorrow of my lot , That , like a plague-infected wretch , I bear Death and destruction hid within my breast ;
That , where I tread , e'en on the healthiest spot , Ere long the blooming faces round betray The writhing features of a ling'ring death .
Pylades .
Were thy breath venom , I had been the first To die that death , Orestes .
Am I not , As ever , full of courage and of joy ?
And love and courage are the spirit_ _s wings Wafting to noble actions .
Orestes .
Noble actions ?
Time was , when fancy painted such before us !
When oft , the game pursuing , on we roam'd O'er hill and valley ; hoping that ere long With club and weapon arm'd , we so might track The robber to his den , or monster huge . And then at twilight , by the glassy sea , We peaceful sat , reclin'd against each=other The waves came dancing to our very feet .
And all before us lay the wide , wide world . Then on a sudden one would seize his sword , And future deeds shone round us like the stars , Which gemm'd in countless throngs the vault of night .
Pylades .
Endless , my friend , the projects which the soul Burns to accomplish .
We would every deed At=once perform as grandly as it shows After long ages , when from land to land The poet's swelling song hath roll'd it on .
It sounds so lovely what our fathers did , When , in the silent evening shade reclin'd , We drink it in with music's melting tones ;
And what we do is , as their deeds to them , Toilsome and incomplete !
Thus we pursue what always flies before ;
We disregard the path in which we tread , Scarce see around the footsteps of our sires , Or heed the trace of their career on earth . We ever hasten on to chase their shades , Which godlike , at a distance far remote , On golden clouds reclin'd , the mountains crown .
The man I prize not who esteems himself Just as the people's breath may chance to raise him .
But thou , Orestes , to the gods give thanks , That they have done so much through thee already .
Orestes .
When they ordain a man to noble deeds , To shield from dire calamity his friends , Extend his empire , or protect its bounds , Or put to flight its ancient enemies , Let him be grateful ! For to him a god Imparts the first , the sweetest joy of life .
Me have they doom'd to be a slaughterer , To be an honour'd mother's murderer , And shamefully a deed of shame avenging .
Me through their own decree they have o'erwhelm'd .
Trust me , the race of Tantalus is doom'd ; Nor may his last descendant leave the earth , Or crown'd with honour or unstain'd by crime .
Pylades .
The gods avenge not on the son the deeds Done by the father .
Each , or good or bad , Of his own actions reaps the due reward .
The parents' blessing , not their curse , descends .
Orestes .
Methinks their blessing did not lead us here .
Pylades .
It was at=least the mighty gods' decree .
Orestes .
Then is it their decree which doth destroy us .
Pylades .
Perform what they command , and wait the event .
Do thou Apollo's sister bear from hence , That they at Delphi may united dwell , Rever'd and honour'd by a noble race : Thee , for this deed , the heav'nly pair will view With gracious eye , and from the hateful grasp Of the infernal Powers will rescue thee .
E'en now none dares intrude within this grove .
Orestes .
So shall I die at=least a peaceful death .
Pylades .
Far other are my thoughts , and not unskill'd Have I the future and the past combin'd In quiet meditation .
Long , perchance , Hath ripen'd in the counsel of the gods The great event .
Diana wish d to leave This savage region foul with human blood . We were selected for the high emprize ;
To us it is assign'd , and strangely thus We are conducted to the threshold here .
Orestes .
My friend , with wondrous skill thou link'st thy wish With the predestin'd purpose of the gods .
Pylades .
Of what avail is prudence , if it fail Heedful to mark the purposes of Heaven ?
A noble man , who much hath sinn'd , some god . h summon to a dangerous enterprize , Which to achieve appears impossible .
The hero conquers , and atoning serves Mortals and gods , who thenceforth honour him .
Orestes .
Am=I foredoom'd to action and to life , Would that a god from my distemper'd brain Might chase this dizzy fever , which impels My restless steps along a slipp'ry path , Stain'd with a mother's blood , to direful death ;
And pitying , dry the fountain , whence the blood , For=ever spouting from a mother's wounds , Eternally defiles me !
Pylades .
Wait in peace !
Thou dost increase the evil , and dost take The office of the Furies on thyself .
Let me contrive , -- be still !
And when at=length The time for action claims our powers combin'd , Then will I summon thee , and on we_ _ll stride , With cautious boldness to achieve the event .
Orestes .
I hear Ulysses speak !
Pylades .
Nay , mock me not .
Each must select the hero after whom To climb the steep and difficult ascent Of high Olympus .
And to me it seems That him nor stratagem nor art defile Who consecrates himself to noble deeds .
Orestes .
I most esteem the brave and upright man .
Pylades .
And therefore have I not desir'd thy counsel .
One step is ta'en already : from our guards I have extorted this intelligence .
A strange and godlike woman now restrains The execution of that bloody law : Incense , and prayer , and an unsullied heart , These are the gifts she offers to the gods .
Her fame is widely spread , and it is thought That from the race of Amazon she springs , And hither fled some great calamity .
Orestes .
Her gentle sway , it seems , lost all its power At the approach of one so criminal , Whom the dire curse enshrouds in gloomy night .
Our doom to seal , the pious thirst for blood Again unchains the ancient cruel rite : The monarch's savage will decrees our death ;
A woman can_ _not save when he condemns .
Pylades .
That _t_ _is a woman is a ground for hope !
A man , the very best , with cruelty At=length may so familiarize his mind , His character through custom so transform , That he shall come to make himself a law Of what at=first his very soul abhorr'd .
But woman doth retain the stamp of mind She first assum'd .
On her we may depend In good or evil with more certainty . She comes ;
leave us alone .
I dare not tell At=once our names , nor unreserv'd confide Our fortunes to her .
Now retire awhile , And ere she speaks with thee we_ _ll meet again .
Scene II .
Iphigenia .
Pylades .
Iphigenia .
Whence art thou ?
Stranger , speak !
To me thy bearing Stamps thee of Grecian , not of Scythian race . ( _She unbinds his chains .
_ ) The freedom that I give is dangerous : The gods avert the doom that threatens you !
Pylades .
Delicious music !
dearly welcome tones Of our own language in a foreign land !
With joy my captive eye once=more beholds The azure mountains of my native coast .
Oh , let this joy that I too am a Greek Convince thee , priestess !
How I need thine aid , A moment I forget , my spirit wrapt In contemplation of so fair a vision .
If fate's dread mandate doth not seal thy lips . From which of our illustrious races , say , Dost thou thy godlike origin derive ?
Iphigenia .
A priestess , by the Goddess' self ordain'd And consecrated too , doth speak with thee .
Let that suffice : but tell me , who art thou , And what unbless'd o'erruling destiny Hath hither led thee with thy friend ?
Pylades .
The woe , Whose hateful presence ever dogs our steps , I can with ease relate .
Oh , would that thou Couldst with like ease , divine one , shed on us One ray of cheering hope !
We are from Crete , Adrastus' sons , and I , the youngest born , Named Cephalus ;
my eldest brother , he , Laodamus . Between us two a youth Of savage temper grew , who oft disturb'd The joy and concord of our youthful sports .
Long as our father led his powers at Troy , Passive our mother's mandate we obey'd ;
But when , enrich'd with booty , he return'd , And shortly after died , a contest fierce For the succession and their father's wealth , Parted the brothers .
I the eldest joined ;
He slew the second ;
and the Furies hence For kindred murder dog his restless steps .
But to this savage shore the Delphian god Hath sent us , cheer'd by hope , commanding us Within his sister's temple to await The blessed hand of aid .
We have been ta'en , Brought hither , and now stand for sacrifice .
My tale is told .
Iphigenia Tell me , is Troy o'erthrown ?
Assure me of its fall .
Pylades .
It lies in ruins .
But oh , ensure deliverance to us !
Hasten , I pray , the promis'd aid of heav'n .
Pity my brother , say a kindly word ;
But I implore thee , spare him when thou speakest .
Too easily his inner mind is torn By joy , or grief , or cruel memory .
A feverish madness oft doth seize on him , Yielding his spirit , beautiful and free , A prey to furies .
Iphigenia .
Great as is thy woe , Forget it , I conjure thee , for a while , Till I am satisfied .
Pylades .
The stately town , Which ten long years withstood the Grecian host , Now lies in ruins , ne'er to rise again ;
Yet many a hero's grave will oft recall Our sad remembrance to that barbarous shore ;
There lies Achilles and his noble friend .
Iphigenia .
And are ye , godlike forms , reduc'd to dust !
Pylades .
Nor Palamede , nor Ajax , ere again The daylight of their native land behold .
Iphigenia .
He speaks not of my father , doth not name Him with the fallen .
He may yet survive !
I may behold him !
still hope on , my heart !
Pylades .
Yet happy are the thousands who receiv'd Their bitter death-blow from a hostile hand !
For terror wild , and end most tragical , Some hostile , angry , deity prepar'd , Instead=of triumph , for the home-returning .
Do human voices never reach this shore ?
Far as their sound extends , they bear the fame Of deeds unparallel'd .
And is the woe Which fills Mycene's halls with ceaseless sighs To thee a secret still ?
-- And know'st thou not That Clytemnestra , with Ægisthus' aid , Her royal consort artfully ensnar'd , And murder'd on the day of his return ?
-- The monarch's house thou honourest !
I perceive Thy heaving bosom vainly doth contend With tidings fraught with such unlook'd-for woe Art thou the daughter of a friend ?
or born Within the circuit of Mycene's walls ?
Do not conceal it , nor avenge on me That here the horrid crime I first announc'd .
Iphigenia .
Proceed , and tell me how the deed was done .
Pylades .
The day of his return , as=from the bath Arose the monarch , tranquil and refresh'd . His robe demanding from his consort's hand , A tangl'd garment , complicate with folds . She o'er his shoulders flung and noble head ;
And when , as=from a net , he vainly strove To extricate himself , the traitor , base Ægisthus , smote him , and envelop'd thus Great Agamemnon sought the shades below .
Iphigenia .
And what reward receiv'd the base accomplice ?
Pylades .
A queen and kingdom he possess'd already .
Iphigenia .
Base passion prompted , then , the deed of shame ?
Pylades .
And feelings , cherish'd long , of deep revenge .
Iphigenia .
How had the monarch injured Clytemnestra ?
Pylades .
By such a dreadful deed , that if on earth aught could exculpate murder , it were this .
To Aulis he allur'd her , when the fleet With unpropitious winds the goddess stay'd ; And there , a victim at Diana's shrine , The monarch , for the welfare of the Greeks , Her eldest daughter doom'd .
And this , _t_ _is said , Planted such deep abhorrence in her heart , That to Ægisthus she resign'd herself , And round her husband flung the web of death .
Iphigenia . ( _veiling herself_ ) .
It is enough !
Thou wilt again behold me .
Pylades , _alone_ .
The fortune of this royal house , it seems , . h move her deeply .
Whosoe'er she be , She must herself have known the monarch well ;
-- For our good fortune , from a noble house , She hath been sold to bondage .
Peace , my heart !
And let us steer our course with prudent zeal Toward the star of hope which gleams upon us .
Act The Third .
Scene I .
Iphigenia .
Orestes .
Iphigenia .
Unhappy man , I only loose thy bonds In token of a still severer doom .
The freedom which the sanctuary imparts , Like the last life-gleam o'er the dying face , But heralds death .
I can_ _not , dare not say Your doom is hopeless ;
for , with murd'rous hand , Could I inflict the fatal blow myself ?
And while I here am priestess of Diana , None , be he who he may , dare touch your heads .
But the incensed king , should I refuse Compliance with the rites himself enjoin'd , Will choose another virgin from my train As my successor .
Then , alas !
with nought , Save ardent wishes , can I succour you , Much honour'd countryman ! The humblest slave , Who had but near'd our sacred household hearth , Is dearly welcome in a foreign land ; How with proportion'd joy and blessing , then , Shall I receive the man who doth recall The image of the heroes , whom I learn'd To honour from my parents , and who cheers My inmost heart with flatt'ring gleams of hope !
Orestes .
Does prudent forethought prompt thee to conceal Thy name and race ?
or may I hope to know Who , like a heavenly vision , meets me thus ?
Iphigenia .
Yes , thou shalt know me .
Now conclude the tale Of which thy brother only told me half : Relate their end , who coming home from Troy , On their own threshold met a doom severe And most unlook'd for .
I , though but a child When first conducted hither , well recall The timid glance of wonder which I cast On those heroic forms .
When they went forth , it seem'd as=though Olympus from her womb Had cast the heroes of a by-gone world , To frighten Ilion ;
and , above them all , Great Agamemnon tower'd pre-eminent !
Oh tell me ! Fell the hero in his home , Though Clytemnestra's and Ægisthus' wiles ?
Orestes .
He fell !
Iphigenia .
Unblest=Mycene !
Thus the sons Of Tantalus , with barbarous hands , have sown Curse upon curse ;
and , as the shaken weed Scatters around a thousand poison-seeds , So they assassins ceaseless generate , Their children's children ruthless to destroy .
-- Now tell the remnant of thy brother's tale , Which horror darkly hid from me before .
How did the last descendant of the race , -- The gentle child , to whom the Gods assign'd The office of avenger , -- how did he Escape that day of blood ?
Did equal fate Around Orestes throw Avernus' net ?
Say , was he saved ?
and is he still alive ?
And lives Electra , too ?
Orestes .
They both survive .
Iphigenia .
Golden Apollo , lend thy choicest beams ! Lay them an offering at the throne of Jove !
For I am poor and dumb .
Orestes .
If social bonds Or ties more close connect thee with this house , As this thy joy evinces , rein thy heart ;
For insupportable the sudden plunge From happiness to sorrow's gloomy depth .
As=yet thou only know'st the hero's death .
Iphigenia .
And is not this intelligence enough ?
Orestes .
Half of the horror yet remains untold ,
Iphigenia .
Electra and Orestes both survive , What have I then to fear ?
Orestes .
And fear'st thou nought For Clytemnestra ?
Iphigenia .
Her , nor hope nor fear Have power to save .
Orestes .
She to the land of hope Hath bid farewell .
Iphigenia .
Did her repentant hand Shed her own blood ?
Orestes .
Not so ;
yet her own blood Inflicted death .
Iphigenia .
Speak less ambiguously .
Uncertainty around my anxious head Her dusky , thousand-folded , pinion waves .
Orestes .
Have then the powers above selected me To be the herald of a dreadful deed , Which , in the drear and soundless realms of night , I fain would hide for=ever ?
' Gainst my will Thy gentle voice constrains me ;
it demands , And shall receive , a tale of direst woe .
Electra , on the day when fell her sire , Her brother from impending doom conceal'd ;
Him Strophius , his father's relative , With kindest care receiv'd , and rear'd the child With his own son , named Pylades , who soon Around the stranger twin'd the bonds of love .
And as they grew , within their inmost souls There sprang the burning longing to revenge The monarch's death .
Unlookd for , and disguis'd , They reach Mycene , feigning to have brought The mournful tidings of Orestes' death , Together with his ashes .
Them the queen Gladly receives . Within the house they enter ;
Orestes to Electra shows himself : She fans the fires of vengeance into flame , Which in the sacred presence of a mother Had burn'd more dimly .
Silently she leads Her brother to the spot where fell their sire ;
Where lurid blood-marks , on the oft-wash'd floor , With pallid streaks , anticipate revenge .
With fiery eloquence she pictures forth Each circumstance of that atrocious deed , -- Her own oppress'd and miserable life , The prosperous traitor's insolent demeanour , The perils threat'ning Agamemnon's race From her who had become their stepmother ;
Then in his hand the ancient dagger thrusts , Which often in the house of Tantalus With savage fury rag'd , -- and by her son Is Clytemnestra slain .
Iphigenia .
Immortal powers ! Whose pure and blest existence glides away ' Mid ever shifting clouds , me have ye kept So many years secluded from the world , Retain'd me near yourselves , consign'd to me The childlike task to feed the sacred fire , And taught my spirit , like the hallow'd flame , With never-clouded brightness to aspire To your pure mansions , -- but at=length to feel With keener woe the misery of my house ?
Oh tell me of the poor unfortunate !
Speak of Orestes !
Orestes .
Would that he were dead !
Forth from his mother's blood her ghost arose , And to the ancient daughters of the night Cries , -- " Let him not escape , -- the matricide !
Pursue the victim , dedicate to you !
" They hear , and glare around with hollow eyes , Like greedy eagles .
In their murky dens They stir themselves , and from the corners creep Their comrades , dire Remorse and pallid Fear ;
Before them fumes a mist of Acheron ;
Perplexingly around the murderer's brow The eternal contemplation of the past Rolls in its cloudy circles .
Once=again The grisly band , commissioned to destroy , Pollute earth's beautiful and heaven-sown fields , From which an ancient curse had banish'd them .
Their rapid feet the fugitive pursue ; They only pause to start a wilder fear .
Iphigenia .
Unhappy one ; thy lot resembles his , Thou feel'st what he , poor fugitive , must suffer .
Orestes .
What say'st thou ?
why presume my fate like his ?
Iphigenia .
A brother's murder weighs upon thy soul ;
Thy younger brother told the mournful tale .
Orestes .
I can_ _not suffer that thy noble soul Should be deceiv'd by error .
Rich in guile , And practis'd in deceit , a stranger may A web of falsehood cunningly devise To snare a stranger ;
-- between us be truth .
I am Orestes !
and this guilty head Is stooping to the tomb , and covets death ;
It will be welcome now in any shape .
Whoe'er thou art , for thee and for my friend I wish deliverance ;
-- I desire it not .
Thou seem'st to linger here against thy will ;
Contrive some means of flight , and leave me here : My lifeless corpse hurl'd headlong from the rock , My blood shall mingle with the dashing waves , And bring a curse upon this barbarous shore !
Iphigenia .
At=length Fulfilment , fairest child of Jove , Thou dost descend upon me from on high !
How vast thine image !
scarce my straining eye Can reach thy hands , which , fill'd with golden fruit And wreaths of blessing , from Olympus' height Shower treasures down .
As by his bounteous gifts We recognize the monarch ( for what seems To thousands opulence is nought to him ) , So you , ye heavenly Powers , are also known By bounty long withheld , and wisely plann'd .
Ye only know what things are good for us ; Ye view the future's wide-extended realm ;
While from our eye a dim or starry veil The prospect shrouds . Calmly ye hear our prayers , When we like children sue for greater speed .
Not immature ye pluck heaven's golden fruit ; And woe to him , who with impatient hand , His date of joy forestalling , gathers death .
Let not this long-awaited happiness , Which yet my heart hath scarcely realiz'd , Like to the shadow of departed friends , Glide vainly by with triple sorrow fraught !
Orestes , _returning_ .
Dost thou for Pylades and for thyself Implore the gods , blend not my name with yours ;
Thou wilt not save the wretch whom thou wouldst join , But wilt participate his curse and woe .
Iphigenia .
My destiny is firmly bound to thine .
Orestes .
No , say not so ;
alone and unattended Let me descend to Hades .
Though thou shouldst In thine own veil enwrap the guilty one .
Thou couldst not shroud him from his wakeful foes ;
And e'en thy sacred presence , heavenly maid , Drives them aside , but scares them not away .
With brazen impious feet they dare not tread Within the precincts of this sacred grove : Yet in the distance , ever and anon , I hear their horrid laughter , like the howl Of famish'd wolves , beneath the tree wherein The traveller hides .
Without , encamp'd they lie , And should I quit this consecrated grove , Shaking their serpent locks , they would arise , And , raising clouds of dust on every side , Ceaseless pursue their miserable prey .
Iphigenia .
Orestes , canst thou hear a friendly word ?
Orestes .
Reserve it for one favour'd by the gods .
Iphigenia .
To thee they give anew the light of hope .
Orestes .
Through clouds and smoke I see the feeble gleam Of the death-stream which lights me down to hell .
Iphigenia .
Hast thou one sister only , thy Electra ?
Orestes .
I knew but one : yet her kind destiny , Which seem'd to us so terrible , betimes Removed an elder sister from the woe That dogs the race of Pelops .
Cease , oh cease Thy questions , maiden , nor thus league thyself With the Eumenides , who blow away , With fiendish joy , the ashes from my soul , Lest the last spark of horror's fiery brand Should be extinguish'd there .
Must then the fire , Deliberately kindl'd and supplied With hellish sulphur , never cease to sear My tortur'd bosom ?
Iphigenia .
In the flame I throw Sweet incense .
Let the gentle breath of love , Low murmuring , cool thy bosom's fiery glow .
Orestes , fondly lov'd , -- canst thou not hear me ?
Hath the terrific Furies' grisly band Completely dried the life-blood in thy veins ?
Creeps there , as=from the Gorgon's direful head , A petrifying charm through all thy limbs ?
If hollow voices , from a mother's blood , Call thee to hell , may not a sister's word With benediction pure ascend to heaven , And summon thence some gracious power to aid thee ?
Orestes .
She calls ! she calls !
-- Thou too desir'st my death ?
Is there a fury shrouded in thy form ?
Who art thou , that thy voice thus horribly Can harrow up my bosom's inmost depths ?
Iphigenia .
Thine inmost heart reveals it .
I am she , Iphigenia , -- look on me , Orestes !
Orestes .
Thou !
Iphigenia .
My own brother !
Orestes .
Hence , away , begone !
Touch not these locks , I counsel thee ;
from me , As=from Creusa's bridal robe , proceeds An unextinguishable fire .
Depart !
Like Hercules , an ignominious death , Unworthy wretch , look'd in myself , I_ _ll die .
Iphigenia .
Thou shalt not perish !
Would that I might hear One quiet word from thee !
dispel my doubts , Make sure the bliss I have implor'd so long .
A wheel of joy and sorrow in my heart Ceaseless revolves .
With shy reserve I turn From one unknown ;
but unto thee , my brother , My inmost heart resistlessly impels me .
Orestes .
Is this Lyæus' temple ? .
h the glow Of holy rage unbridl'd thus possess The sacred priestess ?
Iphigenia .
Hear me , oh , look up !
See how my heart , which hath been clos'd so long , .
Do not repulse me , -- the eternal spring , Whose crystal waters from Parnassus flow , Bounds not more gaily on from rock to rock , Down to the golden vale , than from my heart The waters of affection freely gush , And round me form a circling sea of bliss .
Orestes !
Oh , my brother !
Orestes .
Lovely nymph !
Nor thy caresses , nor thyself I trust ;
Diana claims attendants more severe , And doth avenge her desecrated fane .
Remove thy circling arm !
and if thou wilt Safety and love upon a youth bestow , Unto my friend , more worthy than myself , Impart thy gifts ;
among yon rocks he roves ;
Go seek him , guide him hence , and heed not me .
Iphigenia .
Brother , command thyself , and better know Thy new-found sister , nor misconstrue thus Her pure and heav'nly joy .
Ye Gods , remove From his fix'd eye delusion , lest this hour Of highest bliss should make us trebly wretched !
Oh she is here , thine own , thy long-lost sister , Whom great Diana from the altar snatch'd , And safely plac'd here in her sacred fane .
A captive thou , prepar'd for sacrifice , And findest here a sister in the priestess .
Orestes .
Accursed race !
Now may the sun behold Your final doom .
Is not Electra here ?
That she with us may perish , nor her life For heavier doom and deeper woe reserve .
' Tis well , -- I follow , priestess ! Fratricide Is an old custom of our ancient house ;
And you , ye Gods , I thank , that ye resolve Childless to root me hence .
Thee let me counsel To view too fondly neither sun nor stars .
Come follow to the gloomy realms below !
As dragons , gender'd in the sulphur pool , Swallow each=other with voracious rage , So our accurs'd race destroys itself .
Childless and guiltless come below with me !
There's pity in thy look !
oh , gaze not so , -- ' Twas with such looks that Clytemnestra sought An entrance to her son Orestes' heart , And yet his uprais'd arm her bosom pierc'd . His mother fell !
-- Appear , indignant shade !
Within the circle step , ye fiends of hell , Be present at the welcome spectacle , The last , most horrible , that ye prepare !
Nor hate , nor vengeance , whets the poignard now , A sister is constrain'd to deal the blow .
Weep not !
Thy guiltless soul is free from crime .
From earliest infancy I nought have lov'd , As thee I could have lov'd , my sister .
Come , The weapon raise , spare not , this bosom rend , And make an outlet for its boiling streams ! ( _He sinks exhausted .
_ )
Iphigenia .
Alone I can_ _not bear this bliss and woe .
Where art thou , Pylades ?
Thine aid I need . ( _Iphigenia retires_ .
)
Scene II .
Orestes , _Recovering from his swoon and standing up_ .
Give yet another !
reach from Lethe_ _s stream The last reviving draught of cool refreshment !
Soon shall its waters in my bosom still Life's fitful fever ;
and my spirit then Adown oblivion's stream shall glide to you , Ye spirits , shrouded in eternal mist .
With tranquil pleasure in your deep repose A weary son of earth may lave his soul !
-- What whisp'ring sounds pervade the dreary grove ? What hollow murmurs haunt its twilight gloom ?
-- They gather round to view the stranger guest !
Who are yon troop in high communion met , Like an assembl'd family of princes ?
They mingle peacefully , of every age , And either sex , yet are their godlike forms Cast in a kindred mould .
' Tis they , _t_ _is they , The fathers of my race !
With=Atreus , In friendly converse glides Thyestes' shade , And children playfully around them sport .
Is there no enmity among you now ?
And is revenge extinguish'd with the sun ?
I then am welcome , and may hope to join Your solemn company .
My fathers , hail !
Orestes , last descendant of your race , Salutes you .
What ye sow'd , that hath he reap'd Laden with curses he descends to you .
But burdens here are lighter far to bear .
Receive him , oh , receive him in your circle !
Thee , Atreus , I revere , and thee , Thyestes : Here all are free from enmity and hate .
-- Show me my father , whom I only once In life beheld .
-- Art thou my father , thou , My mother leading thus familiarly ?
Dares Clytemnestra reach her hand to thee ;
Then may Orestes also draw near her , And say , behold thy son !
-- My ancestors , Behold your son , and bid him welcome here , Among the sons of ancient Tantalus , A kind salute on earth was murder's watchword , And all their joys commence beyond the grave .
Ye welcome me !
Ye bid me join your circle !
Oh , lead me to my honour'd ancestor !
Where is the aged hero ?
that I may Behold the dear , the venerable head , Of him , who with the gods in council sat .
You seem to shudder and to turn away ? What may this mean ?
Suffers the godlike man ?
Alas !
the mighty gods , with ruthless hate , To his heroic breast , with brazen chains , Have cruel pangs indissolubly bound .
Scene III .
Orestes .
Iphigenia .
Pylades .
Orestes .
How ! are ye come already ?
Sister , welcome .
Electra still is missing : some kind god With gentle arrow send her quickly hither .
Thee , my poor friend , I must compassionate !
Come with me , come to Pluto's gloomy throne . There to salute our hosts like stranger guests .
Iphigenia .
Celestial pair , who from the realms above By night and day shed down the beauteous light To cheer mankind , but who may not illume Departed spirits , save a mortal pair !
A brother's and a sister's anguish pity ! For thou , Diana , lov'st thy gentle brother Beyond what earth and heaven can offer thee And dost , with quiet yearning , ever turn Thy virgin face to his eternal light . Let not my only brother , found so late , Rave in the darkness of insanity !
And is thy will , when thou didst here conceal me , At=length fulfill'd , -- would'st thou to me through him , To him through me , thy gracious aid extend , -- Oh , free him from the fetters of this curse , Lest vainly pass the precious hours of safety .
Pylades .
Dost thou not know us , and this sacred grove , And this blest light , which shines not on the dead ?
Dost thou not feel thy sister and thy friend , Who hold thee living in their firm embrace ?
Grasp us !
we are not shadows .
Mark my words !
Collect thyself , -- each moment now is precious , And our return hangs on a slender thread , Which , as it seems , some gracious fate doth spin .
Orestes _to_ Iphigenia .
My sister , let me for the first-time taste , With open heart , pure joy within thine arms !
Oh , let me also in my sister's arms , And on the bosom of my friend , enjoy With grateful thanks the bliss ye now bestow My heart assures me that your curses cease .
The dread Eumenides at=length retire , The brazen gates of Tartarus=I hear Behind them closing with a thund'ring clang .
A quick'ning odour from the earth ascends , Inviting me to chase , upon its plains , The joys of life and deeds of high emprise .
Pylades .
Lose not the moments which are limited !
The favouring gale , which swells our parting sail , Must to Olympus waft our perfect joy .
Quick counsel and resolve the time demands .
Act The Fourth .
Scene I .
Iphigenia .
When the Powers on high decree For a feeble child of earth Dire perplexity and woe , And his spirit doom to pass With tumult wild from joy to grief , And back again from grief to joy , In fearful alternation ; They in mercy then provide , In the precincts of his home , Or upon the distant shore , That to him may never fail Ready help in hours of need , A tranquil , faithful friend .
Oh , bless , ye heavenly powers , our Pylades , And every project that his mind may form !
In combat his the vigorous arm of youth , And in the counsel his the eye of age . His soul is tranquil ; in his inner mind He guards a sacred , undisturb'd repose , And from its silent depths a rich supply Of aid and counsel draws for the distress'd .
He tore me from my brother , upon whom , With fond amaze , I gaz'd and gaz'd again ; I could not realize my happiness , Nor loose him from my arms , and heeded not The danger's near approach that threatens us .
To execute their project of escape , They hasten to the sea , where in a bay Their comrades in the vessel lie conceal'd And wait a signal .
Me they have supplied With artful answers , should the monarch send To urge the sacrifice .
Alas ! I see I must consent to follow like a child .
I have not learn'd deception , nor the art To gain with crafty wiles my purposes .
Detested falsehood !
it doth not relieve The breast like words of truth : it comforts not , But is a torment in the forger's heart , And , like an arrow which a god directs , Flies back and wounds the archer .
Through my heart One fear doth chase another ;
perhaps with rage , Again on the unconsecrated shore , The Furies' grisly band my brother seize .
Perchance they are surpris'd ?
Methinks I hear The tread of armed men .
A messenger Is coming from the king , with hasty steps .
How throbs my heart , how troubl'd is my soul Now that I see the countenance of one , Whom with a word untrue I must encounter !
Scene II .
Iphigenia .
Arkas .
Arkas .
Priestess , with speed conclude the sacrifice , Impatiently the king and people wait .
Iphigenia .
I had perform'd my duty and thy will , Had not an unforeseen impediment The execution of my purpose thwarted .
Arkas .
What is it that obstructs the king's commands ?
Iphigenia .
Chance , which from mortals will not brook control .
Arkas .
Possess me with the reason , that with speed I may inform the king , who hath decreed The death of both .
Iphigenia .
The gods have not decreed it .
The elder of these men doth bear the guilt Of kindred murder ;
on his steps attend The dread Eumenides . They seiz'd their prey Within the inner fane , polluting thus The holy sanctuary .
I hasten now , Together with my virgin-train , to bathe Diana's image in the sea , and there With solemn rites its purity restore .
Let none presume our silent march to follow !
Arkas .
This hindrance to the monarch I_ _ll announce : Do not commence the rite till he permit .
Iphigenia .
The priestess interferes alone in this .
Arkas .
An incident so strange the king should know .
Iphigenia .
Here , nor his counsel nor command avails .
Arkas .
Oft are the great consulted out=of form .
Iphigenia .
Do not insist on what I must refuse .
Arkas .
A needful and a just demand refuse not .
Iphigenia .
I yield , if thou delay not .
Arkas .
I with speed Will bear these tidings to the camp , and soon Acquaint thee , priestess , with the king's reply .
There is a message I would gladly bear him : ' Twould quickly banish all perplexity : Thou didst not heed thy faithful friend's advice .
Iphigenia .
I willingly have done whate'er I could .
Arkas .
E'en now _t_ _is not too late to change thy mind .
Iphigenia .
To do so is , alas , beyond our power .
Arkas .
What thou wouldst shun , thou deem'st impossible .
Iphigenia .
Thy wish doth make thee deem it possible .
Arkas .
Wilt thou so calmly venture everything ?
Iphigenia .
My fate I have committed to the gods .
Arkas .
The gods are wont to save by human means .
Iphigenia .
By their appointment everything is done .
Arkas .
Believe me , all doth now depend on thee .
The irritated temper of the king Alone condemns these men to bitter death .
The soldiers from the cruel sacrifice And bloody service long have been disused ;
Nay , many , whom their adverse fortunes cast In foreign regions , there themselves have felt How godlike to the exil'd wanderer The friendly countenance of man appears .
Do not deprive us of thy gentle aid !
With ease thou canst thy sacred task fulfil : For nowhere doth benignity , which comes In human form from heaven , so quickly gain An empire o'er the heart , as where a race , Gloomy and savage , full of life and power , Without external guidance , and oppress'd With vague forebodings , bear life's heavy load .
Iphigenia .
Shake not my spirit , which thou canst not bend According=to thy will .
Arkas .
While there is time Nor labour nor persuasion shall be spar'd .
Iphigenia .
Thy labour but occasions pain to me ; Both are in vain ; therefore , I pray , depart .
Arkas .
I summon pain to aid me . _t_ _is a friend Who counsels wisely .
Iphigenia .
Though it shakes my soul , It doth not banish thence my strong repugnance .
Arkas .
Can then a gentle soul repugnance feel For benefits bestow'd by one so noble ?
Iphigenia .
Yes , when the donor , for those benefits , Instead=of gratitude , demands myself .
Arkas .
Who no affection feels doth never want Excuses .
To the king I_ _ll now relate All that has happen'd .
Oh , that in thy soul Thou wouldst revolve his noble conduct , priestess , Since thy arrival to the present-day !
Scene III .
Iphigenia , _alone_ .
These words at an unseasonable hour Produce a strong revulsion in my breast ;
I am alarm'd !
-- For as the rushing tide In rapid currents eddies o'er the rocks Which lie among the sand upon the shore ; E'en so a stream of joy o'erwhelm'd my soul .
I grasp'd what had appear'd impossible .
It was as=though another gentle cloud Around me lay , to raise me from the earth , And rock my spirit in the same sweet sleep Which the kind goddess shed around my brow , What time her circling arm from danger snatch'd me .
My brother forcibly engross'd my heart ;
I listen'd only to his friend's advice ;
My soul rush'd eagerly to rescue them , And as the mariner with joy surveys The less'ning breakers of a desert isle , So Tauris lay behind me .
But the voice Of faithful Arkas wakes me from my dream , Reminding me that those whom I forsake Are also men .
Deceit doth now become Doubly detested .
O my soul , be still !
Beginn'st thou now to tremble and to doubt ?
Thy lonely shelter on the firm-set earth Must thou abandon ?
and , embark'd once=more , At random drift upon tumultuous waves , A stranger to thyself and to the world ?
Scene IV .
Iphigenia .
Pylades .
Pylades .
Where is she ? that my words with speed may tell The joyful tidings of our near escape !
Iphigenia .
Oppress'd with gloomy care , I much require The certain comfort thou dost promise me .
Pylades .
Thy brother is restor'd !
The rocky paths Of this unconsecrated shore we trod In friendly converse , while behind us lay , Unmark'd by us , the consecrated grove ;
And ever with increasing glory shone The fire of youth around his noble brow .
Courage and hope his glowing eye inspir'd ;
And his free heart exulted with the joy Of saving thee , his sister , and his friend .
Iphigenia .
The gods shower blessings on thee , Pylades !
And from those lips which breathe such welcome news , Be the sad note of anguish never heard !
Pylades .
I bring yet more , -- for Fortune , like a prince , Comes not alone , but well accompanied .
Our friends and comrades we have also found .
Within a bay they had conceal'd the ship , And mournful sat expectant .
They beheld Thy brother , and a joyous shout uprais'd , Imploring him to haste the parting hour .
Each hand impatient long'd to grasp the oar , While from the shore a gently murmuring breeze , Perceiv'd by all , unfurl'd its wing auspicious .
Let us then hasten ; guide me to the fane , That I may tread the sanctuary , and seize With sacred awe the object of our hopes .
I can unaided on my shoulder bear Diana's image : how I long to feel The precious burden ! [ _While speaking the last words , he approaches the Temple , without perceiving that he is not followed by Iphigenia : at=length he turns round .
_ ] Why thus ling'ring stand .
Why art thou silent ?
wherefore thus confus'd ? .
h some new obstacle oppose our bliss ?
Inform me , hast thou to the king announc'd The prudent message we agreed-upon ?
Iphigenia .
I have , dear Pylades ;
yet wilt thou chide .
Thy very aspect is a mute reproach .
The royal messenger arriv'd , and I , According=to thy counsel , fram'd my speech .
He seem'd surpris'd , and urgently besought , That to the monarch I should first announce The rite unusual , and attend his will .
I now await the messenger's return .
Pylades .
Danger again doth hover o'er our heads !
O priestess , why neglect to shroud thyself Within the veil of sacerdotal rites ?
Iphigenia .
I never have employ'd them as a veil .
Pylades .
Pure soul ! thy scruples will destroy alike Thyself and us .
Why did I not foresee Such an emergency , and tutor thee This counsel also wisely to elude ?
Iphigenia .
Chide only me , for mine alone the blame .
Yet other answer could I not return To him , who strongly and with reason urg'd What my own heart acknowledg'd to be right .
Pylades .
The danger thickens ;
but let us be firm , Nor with incautious haste betray ourselves ;
Calmly await the messenger's return , And then stand fast , whatever his reply : For the appointment of such sacred rites .
h to the priestess , not the king belong .
Should he demand the stranger to behold Who is by madness heavily oppress'd , Evasively pretend , that in the fane , Securely guarded , thou retain'st us both .
Thus you secure us time to fly with speed , Bearing the sacred treasure from this race , Unworthy its possession .
Phoebus sends Auspicious omens , and fulfils his word , Ere we the first conditions have perform'd .
Free is Orestes , from the curse absolv'd !
Oh , with the freed one , to the rocky isle Where dwells the god , waft us , propitious gales !
Thence to Mycene , that she may revive ; That from the ashes of the extinguish'd hearth , The household gods may joyously arise , And beauteous fire illumine their abode !
Thy hand from golden censers first shall strew The fragrant incense .
O'er that threshold thou Shalt life and blessing once=again dispense , The curse atone , and all thy kindred grace With the fresh bloom of renovated life .
Iphigenia .
As doth the flower revolve to meet the sun , Once=more my spirit to sweet comfort turns , Struck by thy words' invigorating ray .
How dear the counsel of a present friend , Lacking whose godlike power , the lonely one In silence droops !
for , lock'd within his breast , Slowly are ripen'd purpose and resolve , Which friendship's genial warmth had soon matur'd .
Pylades .
Farewell !
I haste to re-assure our friends , Who anxiously await us : then with speed I will return , and , hid within the brake , Attend thy signal .
-- Wherefore , all=at=once , .
h anxious thought o'ercloud thy brow serene ?
Iphigenia .
Forgive me !
As light clouds athwart the sun , So cares and fears float darkling o'er my soul .
Pylades .
Oh , banish fear !
With danger it hath form'd A close alliance , -- they are constant friends .
Iphigenia .
It is an honest scruple , which forbids That I should cunningly deceive the king , And plunder him who was my second sire .
Pylades .
Him thou dost fly , who would have slain thy brother .
Iphigenia .
To me , at=least , he hath been ever kind .
Pylades .
What Fate commands is not ingratitude .
Iphigenia .
Alas ! it still remains ingratitude ;
Necessity alone can justify it .
Pylades .
Thee , before gods and men it justifies .
Iphigenia .
But my own heart is still unsatisfied .
Pylades .
Scruples too rigid are a cloak for pride .
Iphigenia .
I can_ _not argue , I can only feel .
Pylades .
Conscious of right , thou shouldst respect thyself .
Iphigenia .
Then only doth the heart know perfect ease , When not a stain pollutes it .
Pylades .
In this fane Pure hast thou kept thy heart .
Life teaches us To be less strict with others and ourselves ;
Thou'lt learn the lesson too .
So wonderful Is human nature , and its varied ties Are so involv'd and complicate , that none May hope to keep his inmost spirit pure , And walk without perplexity through life .
Nor are we call'd upon to judge ourselves ;
With circumspection to pursue his path , Is the immediate duty of a man .
For seldom can he rightly estimate , Or his past conduct or his present deeds .
Iphigenia .
Almost thou dost persuade me to consent .
Pylades .
Needs there persuasion when no choice is granted ?
To save thyself , thy brother , and a friend , One path presents itself , and canst thou ask If we shall follow it ?
Iphigenia .
Still let me pause , For such injustice thou couldst not thyself Calmly return for benefits receiv'd .
Pylades .
If we should perish , bitter self-reproach , Forerunner of despair , will be thy portion .
It seems thou art not used to suffer much , When , to escape so great calamity , Thou canst refuse to utter one false word .
Iphigenia .
Oh , that I bore within a manly heart ! Which , when it hath conceiv'd a bold resolve , ' Gainst every other voice doth close itself .
Pylades .
In vain thou dost refuse ;
with iron hand Necessity commands ; her stern decree Is law supreme , to which the gods themselves Must yield submission .
In dread silence rules The uncounsell'd sister of eternal fate .
What she appoints thee to endure , -- endure ;
What to perform , -- perform .
The rest thou know'st .
Ere long I will return , and then receive The seal of safety from thy sacred hand .
Scene V .
Iphigenia , _alone_ .
I must obey him , for I see my friends Beset with peril .
Yet my own sad fate .
h with increasing anguish move my heart .
May I no=longer feed the silent hope Which in my solitude I fondly cherish'd ?
Shall the dire curse eternally endure ?
And shall our fated race ne'er rise again With blessings crown'd ?
-- All mortal things decay !
The noblest powers , the purest joys of life At=length subside : then wherefore not the curse ?
And have I vainly hop'd that , guarded here , Secluded from the fortunes of my race , I , with pure heart and hands , some future day Might cleanse the deep defilement of our house ?
Scarce was my brother in my circling arms From raging madness suddenly restor'd , Scarce had the ship , long pray'd for , near'd the strand , Once=more to waft me to my native shores , When unrelenting fate , with iron hand , A double crime enjoins ; commanding me To steal the image , sacred and rever'd , Confided to my care , and him deceive To whom I owe my life and destiny .
Let not abhorrence spring within my heart ! Nor the old Titan's hate , toward you , ye gods , Infix its vulture talons in my breast !
Save me , and save your image in my soul !
An ancient song comes back upon mine ear -- I had forgotten it , and willingly -- The Parcæ's song , which horribly they sang , What time , hurl'd headlong from his golden seat , Fell Tantalus .
They with their noble friend Keen anguish suffer'd ;
savage was their breast And horrible their song .
In days gone by , When we were children , oft our ancient nurse Would sing it to us , and I mark'd it well .
Oh , fear the immortals , Ye children of men !
Eternal dominion They hold in their hands . And o'er their wide empire Wield absolute sway . Whom they have exalted Let him fear them most !
Around golden tables , On cliffs and clouds resting The seats are prepar'd .
If contest ariseth ;
The guests are hurl'd headlong , Disgrac'd and dishonour'd , And fetter'd in darkness , Await with vain longing , A juster decree .
But in feasts everlasting , Around the gold tables Still dwell the immortals .
From mountain to mountain They stride ; while ascending From fathomless chasms , The breath of the Titans , Half stifl'd with anguish , Like volumes of incense Fumes up=to the skies .
From races ill-fated , Their aspect joy-bringing , Oft turn the celestials , And shun in the children To gaze on the features Once lov'd and still speaking Of their mighty sire .
Thus sternly the Fates sang Immur'd in his dungeon .
The banish'd one listens , The song of the Parcæ , His children's doom ponders , And boweth his head .
Act The Fifth .
Scene I .
Thoas .
Arkas .
Arkas .
I own I am perplex'd , and scarcely know ' Gainst whom to point the shaft of my suspicion , Whether the priestess aids the captives' flight , Or they themselves clandestinely contrive it .
Tis rumour d that the ship which brought them here Is lurking somewhere in a bay conceal'd .
This stranger's madness , these new lustral rites , The specious pretext for delay , excite Mistrust , and call aloud for vigilance .
Thoas .
Summon the priestess to attend me here !
Then go with speed , and strictly search the shore , From yon projecting land to Dian's grove : Forbear to violate its sacred depths ;
A watchful ambush set , attack and seize , According=to your wont , whome'er ye find . [ _Arkas retires .
_ Scene II .
Thoas , _alone_ .
Fierce anger rages in my riven breast , First against her , whom I esteem'd so pure ; Then ' gainst myself , whose foolish lenity Hath fashion'd her for treason .
Man is soon Inur'd to slavery , and quickly learns Submission , when of freedom quite depriv'd .
If she had fallen in the savage hands Of my rude sires , and had their holy rage Forborne to slay her , grateful for her life , She would have recogniz'd her destiny .
Have shed before the shrine the stranger's blood , And duty nam'd what was necessity .
Now my forbearance in her breast allures Audacious wishes .
Vainly I had hop'd To bind her to me ;
rather she contrives To shape an independent destiny .
She won my heart through flattery ; and now That I oppose her , seeks to gain her ends By fraud and cunning , and my kindness deems A worthless and prescriptive property .
Scene III .
Iphigenia .
Thoas .
Iphigenia .
Me hast thou summon'd ?
wherefore art thou here ?
Thoas .
Wherefore delay the sacrifice ?
inform me .
Iphigenia .
I have acquainted Arkas with the reasons .
Thoas .
From thee I wish to hear them more at large .
Iphigenia .
The goddess for reflection grants thee time .
Thoas .
To thee this time seems also opportune .
Iphigenia .
If to this cruel deed thy heart is steel'd , Thou shouldst not come !
A king who meditates A deed inhuman , may find slaves enow , Willing for hire to bear one half the curse , And leave the monarch's presence undefil'd .
Enwrapt in gloomy clouds he forges death , Whose flaming arrow on his victim's head His hirelings hurl ;
while he above the storm Remains untroubl'd , an impassive god .
Thoas .
A wild song , priestess , issued from thy lips .
Iphigenia .
No priestess , king ! but Agamemnon's daughter ;
And thus obeying , ever hath my soul Known sweetest freedom .
But nor then nor now Have I been taught compliance with the voice And savage mandates of a man .
Thoas .
Not I , An ancient law doth claim obedience from thee .
Iphigenia .
Our passions eagerly catch hold of laws Which they can wield as weapons .
But to me Another law , one far more ancient , speaks , And doth command me to withstand thee , king ! That law declaring sacred every stranger .
Thoas .
These men , methinks , lie very near thy heart .
When sympathy with them can lead thee thus To violate discretion's primal law , That those in power should never be provok'd .
Iphigenia .
Speaking or silent , thou canst always know What is , and ever must be , in my heart . .
h not remembrance of a common doom , To soft compassion melt the hardest heart ?
How much=more mine !
in them I see myself .
I trembling kneel'd before the altar once . And solemnly the shade of early death Environ'd me .
Aloft the knife was rais'd To pierce my bosom , throbbing with warm life ; A dizzy horror overwhelm'd my soul ; My eyes grew dim ;
-- I found myself in safety . Are we not bound to render the distress'd The gracious kindness from the gods receiv'd ?
Thou know'st we are , and yet wilt thou compel me ?
Thoas .
Obey thine office , priestess , not the king .
Iphigenia .
Cease !
nor thus seek to cloak the savage force Which triumphs o'er a woman's feebleness .
Though woman , I am born as free as man .
Did Agamemnon's son before thee stand , And thou requiredst what became him not , His arm and trusty weapon would defend His bosom's freedom .
I have only words But it becomes a noble-minded man To treat with due respect the words of woman .
Thoas .
I more respect them than a brother's sword .
Iphigenia .
Uncertain ever is the chance of arms , No prudent warrior doth despise his foe ;
Nor yet defenceless ' gainst severity Hath nature left the weak ;
she gives him craft And wily cunning : artful he delays , Evades , eludes , and finally escapes .
Such arms are justified by violence .
Thoas .
But circumspection countervails deceit .
Iphigenia .
Which a pure spirit doth abhor to use .
Thoas .
Do not incautiously condemn thyself .
Iphigenia .
Oh , couldst thou see the struggle of my soul , Courageously to ward the first attack Of an unhappy doom , which threatens me !
Do I then stand before thee weaponless ?
Prayer , lovely prayer , fair branch in woman's hand , More potent far than instruments of war , Thou dost thrust back .
What now remains for me Wherewith my inborn freedom to defend ?
Must I implore a miracle from heaven ?
Is there no power within my spirit_ _s depths ?
Thoas .
Extravagant thy interest in the fate Of these two strangers .
Tell me who they are , For whom thy heart is thus so deeply mov'd .
Iphigenia .
They are -- they seem at=least -- I think them Greeks .
Thoas .
Thy countrymen ;
no doubt they have renew'd The pleasing picture of return .
Iphigenia , _after a pause_ , .
h man Lay undisputed claim to noble deeds ? .
h he alone to his heroic breast Clasp the impossible ?
What call we great ?
What deeds , though oft narrated , still uplift With shudd'ring horror the narrator's soul , But those which , with improbable success , The valiant have attempted ?
Shall the man Who all alone steals on his foes by night , And raging like an unexpected fire , Destroys the slumbering host , and press'd at=length By rous'd opponents or his foemen's steeds , Retreats with booty -- be alone extoll'd ?
Or he who , scorning safety , boldly roams Through woods and dreary wilds , to scour the land Of thieves and robbers ?
Is nought left for us ?
Must gentle woman quite forego her nature , -- Force against force employ , -- like Amazons , Usurp the sword from man , and bloodily Revenge oppression ?
In my heart I feel The stirrings of a noble enterprize ;
But if I fail -- severe reproach , alas !
And bitter misery will be my doom . Thus on my knees I supplicate the gods .
Oh , are ye truthful , as men say ye are , Now prove it by your countenance and aid ;
Honour the truth in me ! Attend , O king !
A secret plot is laid ; _t_ _is vain to ask Touching the captives ;
they are gone , and seek Their comrades who await them on the shore .
The eldest , -- he whom madness lately seiz'd , And who is now recover'd , -- is Orestes , My brother , and the other Pylades , His early friend and faithful confidant .
From Delphi , Phoebus sent them to this shore With a divine command to steal away The image of Diana , and to him Bear back the sister , promising for this Redemption to the blood-stain'd matricide .
I have deliver'd now into thy hands The remnants of the house of Tantalus . Destroy us -- if thou canst .
Thoas .
And dost thou think The savage Scythian will attend the voice Of truth and of humanity , unheard By the Greek Atreus ?
Iphigenia .
' Tis heard by all , Whate'er may be their clime , within whose breast Flows pure and free the gushing stream of life .
-- What silent purpose broods within thy soul ?
Is it destruction ? Let me perish first !
For now , deliv'rance hopeless , I perceive The dreadful peril into which I have With rash precipitancy plung'd my friends .
Alas !
I soon shall see them bound before me !
How to my brother shall I say farewell ? I , the unhappy author of his death .
Ne'er can I gaze again in his dear eyes !
Thoas .
The traitors have contriv'd a cunning web , And cast it round thee , who , secluded long , Giv'st willing credence to thine own desires .
Iphigenia .
No , no !
I_ _d pledge my life these men are true .
And shouldst thou find them otherwise , O king , Then let them perish both , and cast me forth , That on some rock-girt island's dreary shore I may atone my folly .
Are they true , And is this man indeed my dear Orestes , My brother , long implor'd , -- release us both , And o'er us stretch the kind protecting arm , Which long hath shelter'd me .
My noble sire Fell through his consort's guilt , -- she by her son ;
On him alone the hope of Atreus' race .
h now repose . Oh , with pure heart and hands Let me depart to expiate our house .
Yes , thou wilt keep thy promise ;
thou didst swear , That were a safe return provided me , I should be free to go . The hour is come .
A king doth never grant like common men , Merely to gain a respite from petition ; Nor promise what he hopes will ne'er be claim'd .
Then first he feels his dignity complete When he can make the long-expecting happy .
Thoas .
As fire opposes water , and doth seek With hissing rage to overcome its foe , So doth my anger strive against thy words .
Iphigenia .
Let mercy , like the consecrated flame Of silent sacrifice , encircl'd round With songs of gratitude , and joy , and praise , Above the tumult gently rise to heaven .
Thoas .
How often hath this voice assuag'd my soul !
Iphigenia .
Extend thy hand to me in sign of peace .
Thoas .
Large thy demand within so short a time .
Iphigenia .
Beneficence doth no reflection need .
Thoas .
' Tis needed oft , for evil springs from good .
Iphigenia .
' Tis doubt which good doth oft to evil turn .
Consider not : act as thy feelings prompt thee .
Scene IV .
Orestes ( _armed_ ) .
Iphigenia .
Thoas . Orestes , _addressing his followers_ .
Redouble your exertions !
hold them back !
Few moments will suffice ;
retain your ground , And keep a passage open to the ship For me and for my sister .
_To_ Iphigenia , _without perceiving_ Thoas . Come with speed !
Thoas .
None in my presence with impunity His naked weapon wears .
Iphigenia .
Do not profane Diana's sanctuary with rage and blood .
Command your people to forbear awhile , And listen to the priestess , to the sister .
Orestes .
Say , who is he that threatens us ?
Iphigenia .
In him Revere the king , who was my second father .
Forgive me , brother , that my childlike heart Hath plac'd our fate thus wholly in his hands .
I have betray'd your meditated flight , And thus from treachery redeem'd my soul .
Orestes .
Will he permit our peaceable return ?
Iphigenia .
Thy gleaming sword forbids me to reply .
Orestes , _sheathing his sword_ .
Then speak !
thou seest I listen to thy words . Scene V . Orestes .
Iphigenia .
Thoas .
_Enter_ Pylades , _soon after him_ Arkas , _both with drawn swords_ .
Pylades .
Do not delay !
our friends are putting forth Their final strength , and yielding step=by=step , Are slowly driven backward to the sea .
-- A conference of princes find I here ?
Is this the sacred person of the king ?
Arkas .
Calmly , as doth become thee , thou dost stand , O king , surrounded by thine enemies .
Soon their temerity shall be chastis'd ;
Their yielding followers fly .
-- their ship is ours .
Speak but the word , and it is wrapt in flames .
Thoas .
Go , and command my people to forbear !
Let none annoy the foe while we confer . ( _Arkas retires_ .
)
Orestes .
I willingly consent .
Go , Pylades !
Collect the remnant of our friends , and wait The appointed issue of our enterprize . ( _Pylades retires_ .
)
Scene VI .
Iphigenia .
Thoas .
Orestes .
Iphigenia .
Believe my cares ere ye begin to speak .
I fear contention , if thou wilt not hear The voice of equity , O king , -- if thou Wilt not , my brother , curb thy headstrong youth .
Thoas .
I , as becomes the elder , check my rage .
Now answer me : how dost thou prove thyself The priestess' brother , Agamemnon's son ?
Orestes .
Behold the sword with which the hero slew The valiant Trojans .
From his murderer I took the weapon , and implor'd the Gods To grant me Agamemnon's mighty arm , Success , and valour , with a death more noble .
Select one of the leaders of thy host , And place the best as my opponent here .
Where'er on earth the sons of heroes dwell , This boon is to the stranger ne'er refus'd .
Thoas .
This privilege hath ancient custom here To strangers ne'er accorded .
Orestes .
Then from us Commence the novel custom !
A whole race In imitation soon will consecrate Its monarch's noble action into law .
Nor let me only for our liberty , -- Let me , a stranger , for all strangers fight .
If I should fall , my doom be also theirs ;
But if kind fortune crown me with success , Let none e'er tread this shore , and fail to meet The beaming eye of sympathy and love , Or unconsol'd depart !
Thoas .
Thou dost not seem Unworthy of thy boasted ancestry .
Great is the number of the valiant men Who wait upon me ;
but I will myself , Although advanc'd in years , oppose the foe , And am prepar'd to try the chance of arms .
Iphigenia .
No , no !
such bloody proofs are not requir'd .
Unhand thy weapon , king !
my lot consider ; Rash combat oft immortalizes man ;
If he should fall , he is renown'd in song ;
But after ages reckon not the tears Which ceaseless the forsaken woman sheds ;
And poets tell not of the thousand nights Consum'd in weeping , and the dreary days , Wherein her anguish't soul , a prey to grief , .
h vainly yearn to call her lov'd one back . Fear warn'd me to beware lest robber's wiles Might lure me from this sanctuary , and then Betray me into bondage .
Anxiously I question'd them , each circumstance explor'd , Demanded signs , and now my heart's assur'd .
See here , the mark as=of three stars impress'd On his right-hand , which on his natal day Were by the priest declar'd to indicate Some dreadful deed by him to be perform'd .
And then this scar , which doth his eyebrow cleave , Redoubles my conviction .
When a child , Electra , rash and inconsiderate , Such was her nature , loos'd him from her arms .
He fell against a tripos .
Oh , _t_ _is he !
-- Shall I adduce the likeness to his sire , Or the deep rapture of my inmost heart , In further token of assurance , king ?
Thoas .
E'en though thy words had banish'd every doubt , And I had curb'd the anger in my breast , Still must our arms decide . I see no peace .
Their purpose , as thou didst thyself confess , Was to deprive me of Diana's image .
And think ye that I_ _ll look contented on ?
The Greeks are wont to cast a longing eye Upon the treasures of barbarians , A golden fleece , good steeds , or daughters fair ;
But force and guile not always have avail'd To lead them , with their booty , safely home .
Orestes .
The image shall not be a cause of strife !
We now perceive the error which the God , Our journey here commanding , like a veil , Threw o'er our minds .
His counsel I implor'd , To free me from the Furies' grisly band .
He answer'd , " Back to Greece the sister bring , Who in the sanctuary on Tauris' shore Unwillingly abides ;
so ends the curse ! " To Phoebus' sister we applied the words , And he referr'd to thee !
The bonds severe , Which held thee from us , holy one , are rent , And thou art ours once=more .
At thy blest touch , I felt myself restor'd .
Within thine arms , Madness once=more around me coil'd its folds , Crushing the marrow in my frame , and then For=ever , like a serpent , fled to hell .
Through thee , the daylight gladdens me anew .
The counsel of the Goddess now shines forth In all its beauty and beneficence .
Like to a sacred image , unto which An oracle immutably hath bound A city's welfare , thee Diana took , Protectress of our house , and guarded here Within this holy stillness , to become A blessing to thy brother and thy race .
Now when each passage to escape seems clos'd , And safety hopeless , thou dost give us all .
O king , incline thine heart to thoughts of peace !
Let her fulfil her mission , and complete The consecration of our father's house .
Me to their purified abode restore , And place upon my brow the ancient crown !
Requite the blessing which her presence brought thee , And let me now my nearer right enjoy !
Cunning and force , the proudest boast of man , Fade in the lustre of her perfect truth ; Nor unrequited will a noble mind Leave confidence , so childlike and so pure .
Iphigenia .
Think on thy promise ;
let thy heart be mov'd By what a true and honest tongue hath spoken !
Look on us , king !
an opportunity For such a noble deed not oft occurs .
Refuse thou canst not , -- give thy quick consent .
Thoas .
Then go !
Iphigenia .
Not so , my king !
I can_ _not part Without thy blessing , or in anger from thee .
Banish us not !
the sacred right of guests Still let us claim : so not eternally Shall we be sever'd .
Honour'd and belov'd As mine own father was , art thou by me : And this impression in my soul remains .
Should e'en the meanest peasant of thy land Bring to my ear the tones I heard from thee Or should I on the humblest see thy garb , I will with joy receive him as a god , Prepare his couch myself , beside our hearth Invite him to a seat , and only ask Touching thy fate and thee .
Oh , may the gods To thee the merited reward impart Of all thy kindness and benignity !
Farewell !
Oh , do not turn away , but give One kindly word of parting in=return !
So shall the wind more gently swell our sails , And from our eyes with soften'd anguish flow The tears of separation .
Fare thee well !
And graciously extend to me thy hand , In pledge of ancient friendship .
Thoas , _extending his hand .
_ Fare thee well !
