A large door at the middle back leading out into the garden with fence and garden gate visible .
Beyond one sees the tops of trees ( indicating that the house is situated on a height ) , and in the distance the cathedral and another high building loom against the sky .
The glass windows which extend across the entire back of scene are hung with flowered yellow cretonne , which can be drawn open .
A mirror hangs on the panel between door and window on the left .
Below the mirror is a calendar .
To the right of door a writing table covered with books and writing materials .
A telephone is also on it . To L. of door is a dining table , stove and bureau .
At R. in foreground it small sewing table with lamp on it .
Near it are two arm-chairs .
A hanging lamp at center .
Outside in the street an electric light .
At L. there is a door leading from piazza to the house , at R. a door leading to the kitchen .
Time , the present . ] Act I .
[ Thursday before Easter .
The music before curtain is : Haydn : Sieben Worte des=Erloesers . Introduction : Maestoso=Adagio . ] [ A ray of sunlight falls across the room and strikes one of the chairs near the sewing table .
In the other chair , untouched by the sunshine , sits Christine , running strings thro' muslin sash-curtains .
Elis enters wearing a winter overcoat , unbuttoned . He carries a bundle of legal documents which he puts on the writing table .
After that he takes off his overcoat and hangs it at L . ] ELIS .
Hello , sweetheart .
Christine . Hello , Elis .
ELIS [ Looks around ] .
The double windows are off , the floor scoured , fresh curtains at the windows -- yes , it is spring again !
The ice has gone out=of the river , and the willows are beginning to bud on the banks -- yes , spring has come and I can put away my winter overcoat . [ Weighs his overcoat in his hand and hangs it up .
] You know , it_ _s so heavy -- just as tho' it had absorbed the weight of the whole winter's worries , the sweat and dust of the school-room .
Christine .
But you have a vacation now .
ELIS .
Yes , Easter .
Five days to enjoy , to breathe , to forget . [ Takes Christine's hand a minute , and then seats himself in arm-chair .
] Yes , the sun has come again .
It left us in November . How well I remember the day it disappeared behind the brewery across the street .
Oh , this winter , this long winter .
Christine [ With a gesture toward kitchen ] .
Sh ! Sh !
ELIS .
I_ _ll be quiet -- But I'm so happy that it_ _s over with .
Oh , the warm sun ! [ Rubs his hands as tho' bathing them in the sunshine .
] I want to bathe in the sunshine and light after all the winter gloom --
Christine . Sh !
Sh ! ELIS .
Do you know , I believe that good luck is coming our way -- that hard luck is tired of us .
Christine . What makes you think so ?
Why , as I was going by the cathedral just now a white dove flew down and alighted in=front of me , and dropped a little branch it was carrying right at my feet .
Christine . Did you notice what kind of branch it was ?
ELIS . Of=course it could_ _n't have been an olive branch , but I believe it was a sign of peace -- and I felt the life-giving joy of spring .
Where's mother ?
Christine [ Points toward kitchen ] .
In the kitchen .
ELIS [ Quietly and closing his eyes ] .
I hear the spring !
I can tell that the double windows are off , I hear the wheel hubs so plainly .
And what's that ?
-- a robin chirping out in the orchard , and they are hammering down at the docks and I can smell the fresh paint on the steamers .
Christine .
Can you feel all that -- here in-town ?
ELIS . Here ?
Oh , how did we ever get into this dreadful city where the people all hate each=other and where one is always alone ?
Yes , it was our daily bread that led the way , but with the bread came the misfortunes : father's criminal act and little sister's illness .
Tell me , do you know whether mother has ever been to see father since he_ _s been in prison ?
Christine . Why , I think she_ _s been there this very day . ELIS .
What did she have to say about it ?
Christine .
Nothing -- she would_ _n't talk about it .
ELIS .
Well , one thing at=least has been gained , and that is the quiet that followed the verdict after the newspapers had gorged themselves with the details .
One year is over : and then we can make a fresh start .
Christine .
I admire your patience in this suffering .
ELIS .
Do_ _n't .
Do_ _n't admire anything about me . I am full of faults -- you know it . Christine .
If you were only suffering for your own faults -- but to be suffering for another ! ELIS .
What are you sewing on ?
Christine . Curtains for the kitchen , you dear .
ELIS . It looks like a bridal veil .
This fall you will be my bride , will_ _n't you , Christine ?
Christine . Yes -- but -- let_ _s think of summer first .
ELIS .
Yes , summer ! [ Takes out the check book .
] You see the money is already in the bank , and when school is over we will start for the North , for our home land among the lakes .
The cottage stands there just as it did when we were children , and the linden trees .
Oh , that it were summer already and I could go swimming in the lake !
I feel as=if this family dishonor has besmirched me so=that I long to bathe , body and soul , in the clear lake waters .
Christine . Have you heard anything from Eleonora ? ELIS .
Yes -- poor little sister ! She writes me letters that tear my heart to pieces .
She wants to get out=of the asylum -- and home , of=course . But the doctor dare_ _n't let her go .
She would do things that might lead to prison , he says .
My dear , you are always accusing yourself .
It was fortunate she could be taken care of like that -- poor little thing ! ELIS . Well , perhaps you_ _re right . It is best so . She is as well-off there as she could be anywhere . When I think of how she used to go about here casting gloom over every attempt at happiness , how her fate weighed us down like a nightmare , then I am tempted to feel almost glad about it .
I believe the greatest misfortune that could happen would be to see her cross this threshold .
Selfish brute that I am !
Christine .
Human being that you are !
It seems as tho' some were born to suffer . ELIS .
You poor Christine -- to be drawn into this family , which was cursed from the beginning !
Yes , doomed !
Christine .
You do_ _n't know whether it_ _s all trial or punishment , Elis .
Perhaps I can help you through the struggles .
ELIS .
Do you think mother has a clean dress tie for me ?
Christine [ Anxiously ] .
Are you going out ?
ELIS . I_ _m going out to dinner .
Peter won the debate last night , you know , and he_ _s giving a dinner tonight .
Christine . And you_ _re going to that dinner ?
ELIS . You mean that perhaps I should_ _n't because he has proven such an unfaithful friend and pupil ?
Christine . I can_ _n't deny that I was shocked by his unfaithfulness , when he promised to quote from your theories and he simply plundered them without giving you any credit .
ELIS .
Ah , that_ _s the way things go , but I am happy in the consciousness that « this have I done . » Christine .
Has he invited you to the dinner ?
ELIS . Why , that_ _s true -- come to think of it , he did_ _n't invite me .
That's very strange . Why did_ _n't I think of that before ! Why , he_ _s been talking for years as=though I were to be the guest of honor at that dinner , and he has told others that .
But if I am not invited -- then of=course it_ _s pretty plain that I_ _m snubbed , insulted , in=fact .
Well , it does_ _n't matter .
It is_ _n't the first time -- nor the last . [ Pause .
]
Christine . Benjamin is late .
Do you think he will pass his examinations ?
ELIS . I certainly do -- in Latin particularly . Christine .
Benjamin is a good boy ! ELIS .
Yes , but he_ _s somewhat of a grumbler .
You know of=course why he is living here with us ?
Christine .
Is it because --
ELIS . Because -- my father was the boy's guardian and spent his fortune for him , as he did -- for so many others .
Can you fancy , Christine , what agony it is for me as their instructor to see those fatherless boys , who have been robbed of their inheritance , suffering the humiliations of free scholars ?
I have to think constantly of their misery to be able to forgive them their cruel glances .
Christine . I believe that your father is truly better off than you .
ELIS . Truly !
Christine .
But Elis , we should think of summer , and not of the past . ELIS .
Yes , of summer !
] Shall=I ever go back to them , shall I ever go out from this dreadful city , from Ebal , accursed mountain , and behold Gerizim again ? [ Seats himself near the door .
] Christine .
Aye , aye -- that you shall !
ELIS .
But do you think my birches and lindens will look as they used to -- do_ _n't you think the same dark veil will shroud them that has been lying over-all nature and life for us ever=since the day when father -- [ Points to the empty arm-chair which is in the shadow .
] Look , the sun has gone .
Christine .
It will come again and stay longer . ELIS .
That's true .
As the days lengthen the shadows shorten . Christine .
Yes , Elis , we are going toward the light , believe me .
ELIS . Sometimes I believe that , and when I think of all that has happened , all the misery , and compare it with the present -- then I am happy .
Last year you were not sitting there , for you had gone away from me and broken off our betrothal .
Do you know , that was the darkest time of all .
I was dying literally bit by bit ;
but then you came back to me -- and I lived .
Why did you go away from me ? Christine .
Oh ; I do_ _n't know -- it seems to me now as=if there was no reason .
I had an impulse to go -- and I went , as tho' I were walking in my sleep .
When I saw you again I awoke -- and was happy . ELIS .
-- Here comes mother .
Say nothing , let her live in her imaginary world in which she believes that father is a martyr and that all those he sacrificed are rascals . Mrs . Heyst [ Comes from kitchen .
She is paring an apple . She is simply dressed and speaks in an innocent voice ] .
Good afternoon , children .
Will you have your apple dumpling hot or cold ? ELIS .
Cold , mother dear . Mrs .
Heyst . That's right , my boy , you always know what you want and say so . But you are_ _n't like that , Christine .
Elis gets that from his father ;
he always knew what he wanted and said so frankly , and people do_ _n't like that -- so things went badly with him .
But his day will come , and he_ _ll get his rights and the others will get their just deserts .
Wait now , what was it I had to tell you ?
Oh , yes , what do you think ?
Lindkvist has come here to live !
Lindkvist , the biggest rascal of them all !
ELIS [ Rises , disturbed ] . Has _he_ come here ? Mrs .
Heyst . Yes , indeed , he_ _s come to live right across the street from us . ELIS .
So now we must see him coming and going day in and day out . That too !
Mrs . Heyst .
Just let me have a talk with him , and he_ _ll never show his face again ! For I happen to know a=few things about him !
Well , Elis , how did Peter come out ? ELIS .
Oh , finely ! Mrs . Heyst .
I can well believe that !
When do you think _you_ will join the debating club ?
ELIS . When I can afford it !
Mrs . Heyst .
« When I can afford it . »
Humph , that is_ _n't a very good answer !
And=Benjamin -- did he get through his examinations all=right ?
ELIS . We do_ _n't know yet ;
but he_ _ll soon be here . Mrs . Heyst .
Well , I do_ _n't quite like the way Benjamin goes around looking so conscious of his privileges in this house -- but we shall take him down soon enough .
But he_ _s a good boy just the same .
Oh , yes , there_ _s a package for you , Elis . [ Goes out to kitchen and comes back directly with a package . ] ELIS .
Mother does keep track of everything , does_ _n't she ?
I sometimes believe that she is not so simple minded as she seems to be .
Mrs . Heyst .
See , here's the package .
Lina received it .
Perhaps it is an Easter present ! ELIS .
I_ _m afraid of presents since the time I received a box of cobblestones . [ Puts the package on the table . ] Mrs .
Heyst . Now I must go back to my duties in the kitchen .
Do_ _n't you think it is too cold with the door open ? ELIS .
Not at=all , mother .
Mrs . Heyst . Elis , you should_ _n't hang your overcoat there .
It looks so disorderly .
Now , Christine , will my curtains be ready soon ?
Christine .
In just a=few minutes , mother . Mrs .
Heyst [ To Elis ] .
Yes , I like Peter ;
he is my favorite among your friends . But are_ _n't you going to his dinner this evening , Elis ?
ELIS . Yes , I suppose so .
Mrs . Heyst . Now , why did you go and say that you wanted your apple dumpling cold when you are going out to dinner ?
You_ _re so undecided , Elis .
But Peter is_ _n't like that .
-- Shut the door when it gets chilly , so that you will_ _n't get sniffles . [ Goes out R .
] ELIS .
The good old soul -- and always Peter .
Does she like to tease you about Peter ? Christine [ Surprised and hurt ] .
Me ? ELIS [ Disconcerted ] .
What have you received for a present ?
ELIS [ Opening package ] .
A birch rod ! Christine .
From whom ? ELIS .
It_ _s anonymous .
I shall put it in water -- and it will blossom like Aaron's staff .
" Rod of birch , which in my childhood's hour " -- And so Lindkvist has come here to live !
Christine .
Well , what about him ?
ELIS . We owe him our biggest debt . Christine .
_You_ do_ _n't owe him anything .
ELIS . Yes , one for all and all for one ;
the family's name is disgraced as=long=as we owe a farthing .
Christine . Change your name !
ELIS . Christine !
Christine [ Puts down work , which is finished ] .
Thanks , Elis , I was only testing you .
ELIS .
But you must not tempt me .
Lindkvist is not a rich man , and needs what is due him .
-- When my father got through with it all it was like a battle-field of dead and wounded -- and mother believes father is a martyr !
Christine .
And try to find the sunshine ?
Gladly !
ELIS . I can_ _n't understand how it can be that our Saviour suffered for us and yet we must continue to suffer .
Christine .
Here comes Benjamin .
ELIS .
Can you see whether he looks happy or not ?
Christine [ Looks out door ] .
He walks so slowly , he_ _s stopped at the fountain -- and bathing his eyes .
ELIS . And this too !
Christine .
Walt until -- ELIS .
Tears ! Tears !
Christine . Patience .
[ Enter Benjamin . He has a kind face and seems very downcast .
He carries several books and a portfolio . ] ELIS . Well , how did you get along in Latin ?
Benjamin . Badly ! ELIS .
Let me see your examination paper .
What did you do ?
Benjamin . I used « ut » with the indicative , altbo' I knew it should be the subjunctive .
ELIS . Then you are lost !
But how could you do that ?
Benjamin [ Submissively ] .
I meant to do it right , but some way I wrote it wrong . [ Seats himself dejectedly near dining table . ]
ELIS [ Sinks dozen near writing desk and opens Benjamin's portfolio ] .
Yes , here it is -- the indicative , oh !
Christine [ Faintly , with effort ] .
Well , better luck next time -- life is long .
ELIS .
Yes , it is .
ELIS [ Sadly but without bitterness ] .
But that everything should come at the same time !
You were my best pupil , so what can I expect of the others ?
My reputation as a teacher is lost .
I shall not be allowed to teach any longer and so -- complete ruin ! [ To Benjamin .
] Do_ _n't take it to heart so -- it is not your fault .
Christine [ With great effort ] .
Elis , courage , courage , for God's sake . ELIS .
What shall I get it from ?
Christine . What you got it from before . ELIS .
But things are not as they were .
I seem to be in complete disgrace now .
Christine . There is no disgrace in undeserved suffering .
Do_ _n't be impatient .
Be equal=to the test , for it is just another test . I feel sure of that .
ELIS . Can a year for Benjamin become less=than three hundred and sixty-five days ?
Christine . Yes , a cheerful spirit makes the days shorter .
Be a child then , and let me tell you that .
Think of your mother , how she bears everything .
ELIS .
Give me your hand ;
I am sinking . [ Christine reaches out her hand to him .
] Your hand trembles .
--
Christine . No , not that I know of --
ELIS . You are not so strong as you seem to be --
Christine . I do not feel any weakness --
ELIS . Why can_ _n't you give me some strength then ?
Christine . I have none to spare !
ELIS [ Looking out=of the window ] . Do you see who that is coming ?
[ Christine goes and looks out=of window , then falls upon her knees , crushed . ] Christine .
This is too much !
ELIS .
Our creditor , he who can take our home and all our belongings away from us . He , Lindkvist , who has come here and ensconced himself in the middle of his web-like a spider , to watch the flies --
Christine .
Let us run-away !
ELIS [ At window ] .
No -- no running away !
Now when you grow weak I become strong -- now he is coming up the street -- and he casts his evil eye over toward his prey .
Christine .
Stand aside , at=least .
ELIS [ Straightening himself ] .
No , he amuses me .
His face lights up with pleasure , as tho' he could already see his victims in his trap .
Come on !
He is counting the steps up=to our gate and he sees by the open door that we are at home .
-- But he has met some one and stands there talking .
-- He is talking about us , for he_ _s pointing over here .
Christine . If only he does_ _n't meet mother , so=that she can_ _n't make him harsh with her angry words !
-- Oh , prevent that , Elis !
ELIS . Now he is shaking his stick , as=if he were protesting that in our case mercy shall not pass for justice .
He buttons his overcoat to show that at=least he has_ _n't yet had the very clothes on his back taken from him .
I can tell by his mouth what he is saying .
What shall I reply to him ?
" My dear sir , you are in the right .
Take everything , it belongs to you .
" Christine .
There is nothing=else you could say . ELIS . Now he laughs .
But it is a kind laugh , not a malicious one !
Perhaps he is_ _n't so mean after all , but he_ _ll see that he gets every penny coming to him , nevertheless !
If he would only come , and stop his blessed prating .
-- Now , he is swinging his stick again .
] Do you hear how my heart beats ?
It sounds like an ocean steamer .
Now , thank Heaven , he_ _s taking his leave with his squeaking galoshes !
« Swish , swish , » like a switch !
Oh , but he wears a watch charm !
So he can_ _n't be utterly poverty-stricken .
Listen to the galoshes .
" Angry , angrier , angriest , swish , swish .
" Watch him !
The old wolf ! He sees me !
He sees me !
He bows !
He smiles !
He waves his hand -- and [ Sinks down near the writing table , weeping ] he has gone by !
Christine .
Praise be to God !
ELIS [ Rising ] .
He has gone by -- but he will come again .
Let_ _s go out in the sunshine .
Christine . And what about dining with Peter ?
ELIS . As I am not invited , I can_ _not go .
For that matter , what should I do there in the festivity !
Just go and meet an unfaithful friend !
I_ _m glad , for then you will stay here with us .
ELIS .
I_ _d rather do that , as you know .
Shall we go ?
Christine . Yes , this way .
[ Goes towards left .
ELIS . Courage , boy !
ELIS [ Takes the birch rod from the dining table and puts it behind the looking-glass ] .
It was_ _n't an olive branch that the dove was carrying -- it was a birch rod !
[ They go out . ]
[ Eleonora comes in from back : she is sixteen , with braids down her back .
She carries an Easter lily in a pot .
Without seeing , or pretending not to see Benjamin , she puts the lily on the dining table and then goes and gets a water-bottle from the sideboard and waters the plant . Then seats herself near dining table right opposite Benjamin and contemplates him and then imitates his gestures and movements . ] [ Benjamin stares at her in astonishment .
] Eleonora [ Points to lily ] . Do you know what that is ?
Benjamin [ Boyishly , simply ] . It_ _s an Easter lily -- that_ _s easy enough ;
but who are you ?
Eleonora [ Sweetly , sadly ] . Well , who are you ?
Benjamin . My name is Benjamin and I live here with Mrs.=Heyst .
Eleonora . Indeed !
My name is Eleonora and I am the daughter of Mrs. Heyst . Benjamin .
How strange no=one ever said anything about you !
Eleonora . People do not talk about the dead !
Benjamin . The dead ? Eleonora .
I am dead civilly , for I have committed a very bad deed .
Benjamin . You !
Eleonora . Yes , I spent a trust fund ; but that was_ _n't so much , for it was money as ill-gotten as ill-spent -- but that my poor old father should be blamed for it and be put in prison -- you see , that can never be forgiven .
Benjamin . So strangely and beautifully you talk !
And I never thought of that -- that my inheritance might have been ill-gotten . Eleonora .
One should not confine human beings , one should free them .
Benjamin . You have freed me from a delusion .
Eleonora . You are a charity pupil ?
You must not use harsh words or I shall have to go away .
I am so sensitive I can_ _not bear anything harsh .
Nevertheless it_ _s my fault that you are unhappy . Benjamin .
Your father's fault , you mean .
Eleonora .
That is the same thing , for he and I are one and the same person . [ Pause .
] Why are you so dejected ?
Benjamin . I have had a disappointment !
Eleonora .
Should you be downcast on that account ?
" Rod and punishment bring wisdom , and he who hates punishment must perish -- " What disappointment have you had ?
Benjamin .
I have failed in my Latin examination -- altho' I was so sure I would pass . Eleonora .
Just=so ; you were so sure , so sure , that you would even have laid a wager that you would get thro' it .
Benjamin . I did have a bet on it .
Eleonora . I thought so .
You see that_ _s why it happened -- because you were so sure .
Benjamin . Do you think that was the reason ? Eleonora .
Certainly it was !
Pride goeth before a fall ! Benjamin .
I shall remember that the next time . Eleonora .
That is a worthy thought ;
those who are pleasing to God are of humble spirit .
Benjamin . Do you read the Bible ?
Eleonora . Yes , I read it !
Benjamin . I mean , are you a believer ?
Eleonora . Yes , I mean that I am .
So=much=so that if you should speak wickedly about God , my benefactor , I would not sit at the same table with you .
Benjamin . How old are you ?
Eleonora . For me there is no time nor space .
I am everywhere and whensoever .
I am in my father's prison , and in my brother's school-room . I am in my mother's kitchen and in my sister's little shop far-away .
When all goes well with my sister and she makes good sales I feel her gladness , and when things go badly with her I suffer -- but I suffer most when she does anything dishonest .
Benjamin , your name is Benjamin , because you are the youngest of my friends ;
yes , all human beings are my friends , and if you will let me adopt you , I will suffer for you too .
Benjamin .
I do_ _n't quite understand the words you use , but I think I catch the meaning of your thoughts .
And I will do whatever you want me to .
Eleonora .
Will you begin then by ceasing to judge human beings , even when they are convicted criminals --
Benjamin . Yes , but I want to have a reason for it .
I have read philosophy , you see .
Eleonora . Oh , have you !
Then you shall help me explain this from a great philosopher .
Benjamin . Of=course all logic answers that in the same way , that one can be doomed to commit crime -- . Eleonora .
And that the crime itself is a punishment .
Benjamin . That is pretty deep !
One would think that that was Kant or Schopenhauer .
Eleonora . I do_ _n't know them . Benjamin .
What book did you read that in ?
Eleonora . In the Holy=Scripture .
Benjamin . Truly ?
Are there such things in it ?
Eleonora . What an ignorant , neglected child you are !
If I could bring you up ! Benjamin .
Little you ! Eleonora .
I do_ _n't believe there is anything very wicked about you .
You seem to me more good than bad .
Benjamin . Thank you .
Eleonora [ Rising ] .
You must never thank me for anything .
Remember that .
-- Oh , now my father is suffering .
They are unkind to him . [ Stands as tho' listening .
] Do you hear what the telephone wires are humming ?
-- those are harsh words , which the soft red copper does not like -- when people slander each=other thro' the telephone the copper moans and laments -- [ Severely ] and every word is written in the book -- and at the end of time comes the reckoning !
Benjamin .
You are so severe !
Eleonora .
I ? Not I !
How should I dare to be ?
Benjamin . [ Rises and looks at the pieces of paper which Eleonora is putting together .
] Eleonora [ To herself ] . That people should be so thoughtless as=to leave their secrets in the stove !
Whenever I come I always go right to the stove !
But I do_ _n't do it maliciously -- I would_ _n't do anything like that , for then I should feel remorse .
Benjamin .
It is from Peter , who writes and asks Christine to meet him .
I have been expecting that for a long-time . Eleonora [ Putting her hands over the bits o f paper ] .
Oh , you , what have you been expecting ?
Tell me , you evil-minded being , who believes nothing but bad of people .
This letter could not mean anything wrong to me , for I know Christine , who is going to be my sister sometime .
And that meeting will avert misfortune for brother Elis .
Will you promise me to say nothing of this , Benjamin ?
Benjamin . I do_ _n't exactly think I should like to talk much about it !
Eleonora . People who are suspicious become so unjust .
They think they are so wise , and they are so foolish !
-- But what is all this to me !
Benjamin . Yes , why _are_ you so inquisitive ?
Know about everything ?
Eleonora . That is a fault which I can_ _not overcome .
And I even know what the birds say .
Benjamin . But they can_ _n't talk ?
Eleonora . Have_ _n't you heard birds that people have taught to talk ? Benjamin .
Oh , yes -- that people have taught to talk !
Eleonora .
That is to say they can talk .
And we find those that have taught themselves or are like that instinctively -- they sit and listen without our knowing it and then they repeat these things afterward .
Just now as I was coming along I heard two magpies in the walnut tree , who sat there gossiping .
Benjamin . How funny you are !
But what were they saying ?
Eleonora .
« Peter , » said one of them , « Judas , » said the other .
" The same thing , « said the first one . »
Fie , Fie , Fie , " said the other .
But have you noticed that the nightingales only sing in the grounds of the deaf and dumb asylum here ?
Benjamin . Yes , they do say that_ _s so .
Why do they do that ?
Eleonora . Because those who have hearing do not hear what the nightingales say : but the deaf and dumb hear it !
Benjamin .
Tell me some more stories . Eleonora .
Yes , if you are good .
Benjamin . How good ?
Eleonora . If you will never be exacting about words with me , never say that I said so and so , or=so and so .
Shall I tell you more about birds ?
There is a wicked bird that is called a rat-hawk : as you may know by its name , it lives on rats .
But as it is an evil bird it has hard work to catch the rats .
Because it can say only one single-word , and that a noise such=as a cat makes when it says « miau . »
Now when the rat-hawk says « miau » the rats run and hide themselves -- for the rat-hawk does_ _n't understand what it is saying so it is often without food , for it is a wicked bird !
Would you like to hear more ?
Do you know when I was ill I was made to take henbane , which is a drug that has the power to make one's eyes magnify like a microscope .
But the stars are not up there then , are they ?
Eleonora .
How funny you are !
The stars are always up there -- and now , as I sit facing the west , I can see Cassiopea like a W up there in the middle of the Milky=Way .
Can you see it ?
Benjamin .
No , indeed I can_ _n't see it .
Eleonora .
Let me call your attention to this , that some can see that which others do not do not be too sure of your own eyes therefore !
Now I_ _m going to tell you about that flower standing on the table : it is an Easter lily whose home is in Switzerland ;
it has a calyx which drinks sunlight , therefore it is yellow and can soothe pain .
When I was passing a florist's , just now , I saw it and wanted to make a present of it to brother Elis .
When I tried to go into the shop I found the door was locked -- because it is confirmation day .
But I must have the flower -- I took out my keys and tried them -- can you believe it , my door key worked !
I went in .
You know that flowers speak silently !
Every fragrance uttered a multitude of thoughts , and those thoughts reached me : and with my magnifying eyes I looked into the flowers' workrooms , which no=one else has ever seen .
Then I put a coin on the desk with my card , took the Easter lily and went out .
Benjamin . How thoughtless !
Think if the flower is missed and the money is_ _n't found ?
Eleonora .
That's true !
You are right . Benjamin .
A coin can easily disappear , and if they find your card it_ _s all up with you . Eleonora .
But no=one would believe that I wanted to take anything .
Benjamin [ Looking hard at her ] .
They would_ _n't ?
Eleonora [ Rising ] .
Ah !
I know what you mean !
Like father , like child !
How thoughtless I have been !
Ah !
That which must be , must be ! [ Sits .
] It must be so .
Benjamin .
Could_ _n't we say that --
Eleonora .
Hush !
Let_ _s talk of other things !
Poor=Elis !
Poor all of us !
But it is Easter , and we ought=to suffer .
Is_ _n't there a recital tomorrow ? [ Benjamin nods his head .
] And they give Haydn's Seven=Words on the Cross !
« Mother , behold thy son ! » [ She weeps with face in hands . ] Benjamin .
What kind of illness have you had ?
Eleonora . An illness that is not mortal unless it is God's will !
I expected good , and evil came ;
I expected light , and darkness came .
How was your childhood , Benjamin ?
Benjamin . Oh , I do_ _n't know .
Kind of tiresome !
And yours ?
Eleonora . I never had any .
I was born old .
I knew everything when I was born , and when I was taught anything it was only like remembering .
Do you know , I , too , seem to have thought everything that you say .
Eleonora . I am sure you have .
What made you think that the coin I left at the florist's would be lost ?
Benjamin .
Eleonora .
Have you noticed that too ?
Hush , some one is coming . [ Looks toward back .
] But -- he did_ _n't expect me !
Benjamin , have a pleasant face and be cheerful when my poor brother comes in .
I am going in here while you prepare him for my being here .
But no=matter what he says , do_ _n't you say anything that would hurt him , for that would make me unhappy .
Do you promise ? [ Benjamin nods . ] Give me your hand .
Benjamin [ Reaches out his hand ] .
Eleonora [ Kisses him on the top of his head ] . So !
Now you are my little brother .
God bless and keep you ! [ Goes toward the left and as she passes Elis' overcoat she pats it lovingly on the sleeve .
ELIS [ In from back , troubled ] .
Mrs . Heyst [ In from kitchen ] . ELIS .
Oh , so there you are , mother .
Mrs . Heyst .
Was it you ?
I thought I heard a strange voice ! ELIS .
I have some news . I met our lawyer in the street .
Mrs . Heyst . Well ? ELIS .
The case is going to the superior court -- and to gain time I_ _ve got to read all the minutes of the case . Mrs . Heyst .
Well , that will_ _n't take you long .
Heyst .
Yes , but the superior court will free him ! ELIS .
No , mother , he has confessed .
Mrs . Heyst .
He said that to console you . Mrs .
Heyst [ Coldly ] . Are you going out to dinner ? ELIS . No. Mrs .
Heyst .
Oh , so you_ _ve changed your mind again . ELIS .
Yes . Mrs .
Heyst . Oh , you are so changeable !
ELIS . I know it , but I am tossed about like a chip in a high sea . Mrs .
Heyst . I surely thought I heard a strange voice that I half recognized .
But I must have been mistaken . [ Points to Elis' overcoat .
] That coat ought not to hang there , I said . [ Goes out R .
]
ELIS [ Goes to L.=Sees the lily on table ] .
Where did that plant come from ?
Benjamin .
There was a young lady here with it . ELIS .
Young lady !
What's that ?
Who was it ?
Benjamin . It was -- ELIS .
Was it -- my sister ?
Benjamin . Yes .
ELIS [ Sinks down near table ] . [ Pause .
] Did you talk with her ?
Benjamin .
Yes , indeed !
ELIS .
Oh , God , is there more to be endured ? Was she angry with me ?
Benjamin . She ?
No , she was so sweet , so gentle .
ELIS .
How wonderful !
Did she talk about me ?
Was she very vexed with me ?
Benjamin .
No , on=the=contrary she said you were her best , her only friend on earth . ELIS .
What a strange change !
Benjamin .
And when she went , she patted your coat on the sleeve --
ELIS . Went ?
Where has she gone ?
Benjamin [ Pointing to the window door ] . In=there ! ELIS .
She is in=there then ?
Benjamin . Yes .
ELIS . You look so happy and cheerful , Benjamin .
Benjamin . She talked so beautifully to me . ELIS .
What did she talk about ?
Benjamin . She told me some of her own stories -- and a=lot about religion .
ELIS [ Rising ] .
Which made you happy ?
Benjamin . Yes , indeed !
ELIS . Poor Eleonora , who is so unfortunate herself and yet can make others happy ! [ Goes to door left , hesitating .
] God help us !
Act II .
[ Good Friday evening . The music before and thro' the act , Haydn's Sieben Worte .
Largo No. 1. « Pater dimitte illis . »
Same scene . Curtains are drawn , lighted up by electric light in the street .
The hanging lamp is lighted .
On dining table a small lamp , also lighted .
There is a glimmer from the lighted stove .
Elis and Christine are sitting at the sewing table .
Benjamin and Eleonora are seated at dining table reading , opposite each=other , with the small lamp between them -- Eleonora has a shawl over her shoulders .
] [ They are all dressed in black .
The papers that Elis brought in the First Act are on the writing table in a disorderly condition , the Easter lily stands on sewing table .
An old clock stands on the dining table .
Now=and=then one sees shadows of people passing by in the street .
] [ The cathedral organ is heard faintly .
-- The following scene must be played softly .
] ELIS [ Softly to Christine ] .
Yes -- it_ _s Good=Friday -- Long Friday they call it in some countries . Ah -- yes -- it is long .
And the snow has softened the noises in the street like straw spread before the house of the dying .
Not a sound to be heard -- [ Music louder ] only the cathedral organ -- [ A long pause .
] Christine . Mother must have gone to vespers . ELIS .
Yes . -- She never goes to high mass any=more .
The cold glances people give her hurt her too much .
Christine .
It_ _s queer about these people they sort of demand that we should keep out=of the way , and they even see fit to -- ELIS .
Yes -- and perhaps they are right . --
Christine . On=account=of the wrong-doing of one , the whole family is excommunicated -- ELIS .
Yes -- that is the way things go .
ELIS [ Noticing them ] . Look at them !
Christine .
Is_ _n't it beautiful ? How well they get along together .
ELIS . How fortunate it is that Eleonora has grown so calm and contented .
Oh , that it might only last !
Christine . Why should_ _n't it last ?
ELIS . Because -- happiness does_ _n't last very long usually .
Christine . Elis ! ELIS .
Oh , I am afraid of everything today . [ Benjamin moves the lamp slowly over to Eleonora's side . ] Christine .
Look at them ! [ Pause . ]
ELIS . Have you noticed the change in Benjamin ?
His fierce defiance has given way to quiet submissiveness .
Christine . It_ _s her doing . Her whole being seems to give out sweetness .
ELIS . She has brought with her the spirit of peace , that goes about unseen and exhales tranquillity .
Do you think that she is really recovered now ? ELIS . Yes .
If it were_ _n't for this over-sensitiveness .
Now she is reading the story of the crucifixion and some of the time she is weeping .
Christine . We used to read it at school , I remember , on Wednesdays , when we fasted .
ELIS . Do_ _n't talk so loud -- she will hear you .
Christine . Not now -- she is so far-away .
ELIS .
Have you noticed the quiet dignity that has come into Benjamin's face ?
Christine .
That's on=account=of suffering .
Too much happiness makes everything commonplace .
ELIS .
Do_ _n't you think it may be -- love ?
Do_ _n't you think that those little --
Christine . Sh -- sh -- do_ _n't touch the wings of the butterfly -- or it will fly away .
ELIS .
They must be looking at each=other , and only pretending to read .
I have_ _n't heard them turn over any pages .
Christine . Hush !
[ Eleonora rises , goes on tip-toe to Benjamin and puts her shawl over his shoulders .
Benjamin protests mildly but gives in to her wish -- Eleonora returns to her seat and pushes the lamp over to Benjamin's side .
]
Christine .
She does_ _n't know how well she wishes .
Poor little Eleonora -- [ Pause .
] ELIS [ Rises ] .
Now I must return to the law papers .
Christine .
Do you think anything will be gained by going over all that again ?
ELIS .
Only one thing .
That is to keep up mother's hope .
I only pretend to read -- but a word now=and=then pricks me like a thorn in the eye .
Yesterday the sun was shining -- and in our fancy we went out to the country , -- Christine , think if we should have to stay here all summer .
Christine . We would save a great deal of money -- but it would be disappointing .
ELIS .
I could_ _n't live thro' it -- I have stayed here three summers -- and it_ _s like a dead city to me .
The rats come out from the cellars and alleys -- while the cats are out spending the summer in the country .
And all the old women that could_ _n't get away sit peeking through the blinds gossiping about their neighbors -- « See , he has his winter suit on » -- and sneer at the worn-down heels of the passers-by .
And from the poor quarters wretched beings drag themselves out=of their holes , cripples , creatures without noses or ears , the wicked and unfortunate -- filling the parks and squares as=if they had conquered the city -- there where the well-dressed children just played , while their parents or maids looked on and encouraged them in their frolics .
I remember last summer when I -- Christine .
Oh , Elis -- Elis -- look forward -- look forward .
ELIS .
Is it brighter there ?
Christine .
Let us hope so . ELIS [ Sits at writing table ] .
If it would only stop snowing out=there , so we could go out for a walk ! Christine .
Dearest Elis , yesterday you wanted night to come , so=that we might be shielded from the hateful glances of the people .
You said , « Darkness is so kind , » and that it_ _s like drawing the blanket over one's head .
ELIS .
That only goes to prove that my misery is as great one way as the other . [ Reading papers .
] The worst part of the suit is all the questioning about father's way of living .
-- It says here that we gave big dinner parties .
-- One witness practically says that my father was a drunkard -- no , that_ _s too much . No. No , I will_ _n't -- as tho'-- I must go thro' it , I suppose .
-- Are_ _n't you cold ?
Christine .
No. But it is_ _n't warm here .
Is_ _n't Lina home ?
ELIS . She_ _s gone to church .
Christine .
Oh , yes , that_ _s so .
But mother will soon be home . ELIS .
I am always afraid to have her come home .
She has had so many experiences of people's evil and malice .
Christine .
There is a strain of unusual melancholy in your family , Elis .
ELIS . And that_ _s why none but the melancholy have ever been our friends . Light-hearted people have always avoided us -- shrunk from us .
Christine .
There is mother , going in the kitchen door . ELIS .
Do_ _n't be impatient with her , Christine . Christine .
Impatient !
Ah , no , it_ _s worse for her than any of us .
But I can_ _n't quite understand her .
ELIS . She is always trying to hide our disgrace . That's why she seems so peculiar . Poor mother ! Mrs .
Heyst [ Enters , dressed in black , psalm book in-hand , and handkerchief ] .
Good evening , children .
All . Good evening , mother dear . Mrs . Heyst .
Why are you all in black , as tho' you were in mourning ? [ Pause .
] ELIS .
Is it still snowing , mother ?
Mrs . Heyst .
It_ _s sleeting now . [ Goes over to Eleonora .
] Are_ _n't you cold out here ? [ Eleonora shakes her head .
] Well , my little one , you are reading and studying , I see . [ To Benjamin .
] And you too ?
Mrs .
Heyst [ Hiding her feelings ] . So , my child -- so -- so -- ELIS .
Have you been to vespers , mother ? Mrs .
Heyst . Yes , but they had some visiting pastor , and I did_ _n't like him , he mumbled his words so .
ELIS .
Did you meet any one you knew ?
Mrs . Heyst . Yes , more is the pity . ELIS .
Then I know whom -- Mrs .
Heyst . Yes , Lindkvist .
And he came up=to me and --
ELIS . Oh , how terrible , how terrible --
Mrs . Heyst .
He asked how things were going -- and imagine my fright -- he asked if he might come and see us this evening .
ELIS . On a holy day ?
Mrs . Heyst .
I was speechless -- and he , I am afraid , mistook my silence for consent .
So he may be here any moment .
ELIS [ Rises ] .
Here ?
Mrs . Heyst . He said he wished to leave a paper of some sort which was important . ELIS . A warrant !
He wants to take our furniture . Mrs .
Heyst . But he looked so queer .
I did_ _n't quite understand him .
ELIS .
Well , then -- let him come -- he has right and might on his side , and we must bow down to him .
-- We must receive him when he comes . Mrs .
Heyst . If I could only escape seeing him !
ELIS . Yes , you must stay in the house . Mrs .
Heyst . But the furniture he can_ _not take .
How could we live if he took the things away ?
One can_ _not live in empty rooms .
ELIS .
That's the way rogues should be made to live -- not honest people .
ELIS [ By the writing table ] . I have been reading it all=over again . Mrs . Heyst .
Did you find any faults ? What was it the lawyer called them ?
Oh -- technical errors ? ELIS . No. I do_ _n't think there are any . Mrs .
Heyst . But I met our lawyer just now and he said there must be some technical errors a challengeable witness , an unproven opinion -- or a contradiction , he said .
You should read carefully .
ELIS . Yes , mother dear , but it_ _s somewhat painful reading all this -- Mrs . Heyst .
But now listen to this . I met our lawyer , as I said , and he told me also that a burglary had been committed here in town yesterday , and in broad daylight .
[ Eleonora and Benjamin start and listen .
] ELIS .
A burglary !
Where ?
Mrs . Heyst . At the florist's on Cloister street .
But the whole thing is very peculiar .
It_ _s supposed to have happened this way : the florist closed his place and went to church where his son -- or was it his daughter ?
-- was being confirmed .
When he returned , about three o'clock -- or perhaps it was four , but that does_ _n't matter -- well , he found the door of the store wide open and his flowers were gone -- at=least a whole lot of them . [ They all look at her questioningly .
] Well , anyway , a yellow tulip was gone , which he missed first .
ELIS . A yellow tulip ?
Had it been a lily I would have been afraid . Mrs .
Heyst . No , it was a tulip , that_ _s sure , well , they say the police are on the track of the thief anyway .
[ Eleonora has risen as=if to speak , but is quieted by Benjamin , who goes to her and whispers something to her . ] Mrs . Heyst . Think of it , on Holy=Thursday !
When young people are being confirmed at the church , to break into a place and steal !
Do you know who it is they suspect ? Mrs . Heyst .
No. But it was a peculiar thief .
He did_ _n't take any money from the cash drawer .
Christine .
Oh , that this day were ended !
Mrs . Heyst .
And if Lina would only return -- [ Pause .
] Oh , I heard something about the dinner Peter gave last night .
What do you think -- the Governor himself was there . ELIS . The Governor at Peter's -- ?
I_ _m astonished . Peter has always avowed himself against the Governor's party .
Mrs . Heyst . He must have changed then . ELIS .
He was_ _n't called Peter for nothing , it seems .
Mrs . Heyst .
But what have _you_ got against the Governor ?
ELIS . He is against progress -- he wants to restrict the pleasures of the people , he tries to dictate to the boards of education -- I_ _ve felt his interference in my school .
Mrs . Heyst .
I can_ _n't understand all that -- but it does_ _n't matter .
Anyhow the Governor made a speech , they say , and Peter thanked him heartily .
ELIS .
And with great feeling , I can fancy , and denied his master , saying , « I=know=not=this=man , » and again the cock crew . Was_ _n't the Governor's name Pontius and his surname Pilate ?
Mrs . Heyst .
You must_ _n't be so bitter , Elis .
Human beings are weak and we must come in contact with them . ELIS . Hush , -- I hear Lindkvist coming . Mrs . Heyst .
What ? Can you hear him in all this snow ? ELIS .
Yes , I can hear his stick striking the pavement -- and his squeaking galoshes .
Please , mother , go into the house . Mrs .
Heyst .
No. I shall stay and tell him a=few things . ELIS .
Dear , dear mother , you must go in or it will be too painful .
Mrs .
Heyst [ Rising , with scorn ] .
Oh , may the day that I was born be forgotten -- Christine . Do_ _n't blaspheme , mother .
Mrs . Heyst .
Should not the lost have this trouble rather=than that the worthy should suffer torture ?
ELIS . Mother !
Mrs . Heyst .
Oh , God !
Why have you forsaken me and my children ? [ Goes out L .
]
ELIS . Oh -- do you know that mother's indifference and submission torture me more=than her wrath ? Christine .
Her submission is only pretended or make-believe . There was something of the roar of the lioness in her last words . Did you notice how big she became ?
ELIS [ At window , listening ] .
He has stopped -- perhaps he thinks the time ill-chosen .
-- But that can_ _n't be it -- he who could write such terrible letters , -- and always on that blue paper !
I can_ _n't look at a blue paper now without trembling . Christine . What will you tell him -- what do you mean to propose ? ELIS .
I do_ _n't know .
I have lost all my reasoning powers .
-- Shall I fall on my knees to him and beg mercy -- can you hear him ?
I can_ _n't hear anything but the blood beating in my ears .
Christine .
Let us face the worst calmly -- he will take everything and --
ELIS . Then the landlord will come and ask for some=other security , which I can_ _not furnish .
-- He will demand security , when the furniture is no longer here to assure him of the rent .
Christine [ Peeking through the curtain ] .
He is_ _n't there now .
-- He is gone !
ELIS [ Rushing to window ] .
He_ _s gone ?
-- Do you know , now that I think of Lindkvist , I see him as a good-natured giant who only scares children .
How could I have come to think that ?
Christine .
Oh , thoughts come and go -- ELIS .
How lucky that I was not at that dinner yesterday -- I would surely have made a speech against the Governor , and so I would have spoiled everything for us .
Christine .
Do you realize that now ? ELIS .
Thanks for your advice , Christine .
You knew your Peter .
Christine .
My Peter ? --
ELIS .
I meant -- my Peter .
-- But -- look -- he is here again , woe unto us !
[ One can see the shadow of Lindkvist on the curtain , who is nearing slowly .
The shadow gets larger and larger , until it is giant-like .
They stand in fear and tremble . ]
ELIS .
Look , -- the giant -- the giant that wants to swallow us .
Christine . Now it_ _s time to laugh , as when reading fairy-tales . ELIS .
I can_ _n't laugh any=more .
[ The shadow slowly disappears . ]
ELIS [ Brightly ] .
He_ _s gone -- he_ _s gone -- yes , I can breathe again now , as he will_ _n't return until tomorrow . Oh , the relief !
Christine .
Yes , and tomorrow the sun will be shining , -- the snow will be gone and the birds will be singing -- eve of the resurrection !
ELIS .
Yes , tell me more=like that -- I can see everything you say .
Christine . If you could but see what is in my heart , if you could see my thoughts and my good intentions , my inmost prayer , Elis -- Elis -- when I now ask -- [ Hesitates .
] ELIS .
What ?
Tell me .
Christine . When I beg you now to --
ELIS [ Alarmed ] .
Tell me -- Christine .
It_ _s a test .
Will you look at it as a test ?
ELIS .
A test ?
Well then .
Christine . Let me -- do let me -- No , I dare_ _n't . [ Eleonora listens .
] ELIS .
Why do you torture me ?
Christine . I_ _ll regret it , I know .
So be it !
Elis , let me go to the recital this evening . ELIS .
What recital ?
Christine . Haydn's « Seven=Words=on=the=Cross , » at the cathedral .
ELIS .
With whom ?
Christine .
Alice . ELIS .
And ? Christine . Peter !
ELIS .
With Peter ? Christine . See , now you frown . I regret telling you , but it_ _s too late now .
ELIS . Yes . It is somewhat late now , but explain --
Christine .
I prepared you , told you that I could_ _n't explain , and that_ _s the reason I begged your boundless faith .
ELIS [ Mildly ] . Go .
I trust you .
But I suffer to know that you seek the company of a traitor . Christine .
I realize that , but this is to be a test .
ELIS .
Which I can_ _not endure . Christine .
You must . ELIS .
I would like to , but I can_ _not .
But you must go nevertheless . Christine .
Your hand !
ELIS [ Giving his hand ] .
There -- [ The telephone rings ;
Elis goes to it .
] Hello !
-- No answer .
Hello !
-- No answer but my own voice .
-- Who is it ?
-- That's strange .
I only hear the echo of my own words .
Christine . That might be possible .
ELIS [ Still at ' phone ] .
Hello !
-- But this is terrible ! [ Hangs up receiver .
] Go now , Christine , and without any explanations , without conditions .
I shall endure the test .
Christine .
Yes , do that and all will be well .
ELIS .
I will .
-- [ Christine starts R .
] Why do you go that way ?
Christine .
My coat and hat are in=there . Good bye for now . [ Goes out R .
] ELIS .
Good-bye , my friend , [ Pause ] forever . [ He rushes out L .
]
Eleonora .
God help us , what have I done now ?
The police are after the guilty one , and if I am discovered -- then -- [ With a shriek ] they_ _ll send me back there . [ Pause .
] But=I must_ _n't be selfish .
Oh , poor mother and poor Elis !
Benjamin [ Childishly ] .
Eleonora , you must tell them that I did it . Eleonora .
Could you make another's guilt yours , you child ? Benjamin .
That's easy , when one knows he_ _s innocent .
Eleonora .
One should never deceive .
Benjamin .
No , but let me telephone to the florist and explain to him .
Eleonora .
No , I did wrong , and I must take the consequences .
I have awakened their fear of burglars , and I must be punished .
Benjamin .
But what if the police come in ?
Eleonora .
That would be dreadful -- but what must be , must be .
Oh , that this day were ended ! [ Takes clock from table and puts the hands forward .
] Dear old clock , go a=little faster -- tick , tick , tick . [ The clock strikes eight .
] Now it_ _s eight . [ Moves hands again .
] Tick , tick , tick . [ Business with clock .
] Now it_ _s nine -- ten -- eleven -- twelve -- o'clock . Now it is Easter eve , and the sun will soon be rising , and then we_ _ll color the Easter eggs . Benjamin .
You can make time fly , can_ _n't you ? Eleonora .
How they must suffer !
Eleonora . Night is hardest for them -- they are afraid of the darkness , but they can_ _n't run-away , and so they must stay there thro' the long winter night , waiting for spring , which is their dawn .
Everybody and everything must suffer , but the flowers suffer most .
Yes , and the song-birds , they have returned ;
where are they to sleep tonight ?
Benjamin [ Childishly ] .
In the hollow trees . Eleonora . There are_ _n't hollow trees enough to hold them all .
I have only noticed two hollow trees in the orchard , and that_ _s where the owls live , and they kill the song birds . [ Elis is heard playing the piano inside .
Eleonora and Benjamin listen for a=few moments . ] Poor=Elis , who thinks that Christine has gone from him , but I know that she will return .
Benjamin .
Why do_ _n't you tell him , if you know ?
Eleonora , Because=Elis must suffer ;
every one should suffer on Good Friday , that they may remember Christ's suffering on the cross . [ The sound of a policeman's whistle is heard off in the distance .
] Eleonora [ Starts up ] .
What was that ? Benjamin .
Do_ _n't you know ?
Eleonora .
No. Benjamin .
It_ _s the police .
Eleonora .
Ah , yes , that_ _s the way it sounded when they came to take father away -- and then I became ill .
-- And now they are coming to take me . Benjamin [ Rushing to the door and guarding it ] .
No , no , they must not take you .
I shall defend you , Eleonora .
Eleonora .
That's very beautiful , Benjamin , but you must_ _n't do that .
Benjamin [ Looking thro' curtain ] . There are two of them . [ Eleonora tries to push Benjamin aside .
He protests mildly . ] No , no , not you , then -- I do_ _n't want to live any longer .
Eleonora .
Benjamin , go and sit down in that chair , child , sit down .
[ Benjamin obeys much against his will .
] Eleonora [ Peeps thro' curtain ] . Oh ! [ Laughs . ] It_ _s only some boys .
Oh , we doubters !
Do you think that God would be angry , when I did_ _n't do any harm , only acted thoughtlessly ?
It served me right -- I should_ _n't have doubted .
Benjamin .
But tomorrow that man will come and take the things .
Eleonora .
Let him come .
Then we_ _ll go out under the sky , away from everything -- away from all the old home things that father gathered for us , that I have seen since I was a child .
Yes , one should never own anything that ties one down=to=earth .
Now you are so serious again ! Eleonora .
We must be today .
But do you know what will be hardest to part with ?
This dear old clock .
We had it when I was born and it has measured out all my hours and days . [ She takes the clock from table .
] Listen , it_ _s like a heart beating , -- just like a heart .
-- They say it stopped the very hour that grandfather died .
We had it as long=ago as that .
Good-bye , little timekeeper , perhaps you_ _ll stop again soon . [ Putting clock on table again .
] Do you know , it used to gain time when we had misfortune in the house , as tho' it wished to hasten thro' the hours of evil , for our sake of=course .
But when we were happy it used to slow down so=that we might enjoy longer .
That's what this good clock did .
But we have another , a very bad one -- and now it has to hang in the kitchen .
It could_ _n't bear music , and as=soon=as Elis would play on the piano it would start to strike . Oh , you needn't smile ;
we all noticed it , not I alone , and that_ _s why it has to stay out in the kitchen now , because it would_ _n't behave .
But Lina does_ _n't like it either , because it will_ _n't be quiet at night , and she can_ _not time eggs by it .
When she does , the eggs are sure to be hard-boiled -- so Lina says .
But now you are laughing again . Benjamin .
Yes , how can I help --
Eleonora .
You are a good boy , Benjamin , but you must be serious . Keep the birch rod in mind ;
it_ _s hanging behind the mirror . Benjamin .
But you say such funny things , that I _must_ smile .
And why should we be weeping always ?
Eleonora . Shall we not weep in the vale of tears ?
Benjamin . H'm .
Eleonora . You would rather laugh all=the=time , and that_ _s why trouble comes your way .
But it_ _s when you are serious that I like you best .
Remember that . [ Pause . ] Benjamin .
Do you think that we will get out=of this trouble , Eleonora ?
Eleonora . Yes , most of it will take care of itself , when Good=Friday is over , but not all of it -- today the birch rod , tomorrow the Easter eggs -- today snow -- tomorrow thaw .
Today death -- tomorrow life -- resurrection .
Benjamin .
How wise you are !
Eleonora .
Even now I can feel that it is clearing outside -- and that the snow is melting -- I can smell the melting snow .
And tomorrow violets will sprout against walls facing south .
The clouds are lifting -- I feel it -- I can breathe easier .
-- Go and pull the shades up , Benjamin .
I want God to see us .
[ Benjamin rises and obeys .
Moonlight streams into the room .
] Eleonora .
The moon is full -- Easter moon ! But you know it is really the sun shining , although the moon gives us the light -- the light ! Act III .
[ Easter eve . The music before and thro' this act , Haydn's Sieben=Worte .
No. 5. Adagio . Scene the same . The curtains are up .
The landscape outside is in a grey light .
There is a fire in the stove .
The doors are closed .
Eleonora . Where have you been all this long-time , Benjamin ? Benjamin .
It has_ _n't been very long .
Eleonora . I have wanted you so ! Benjamin .
Have you ? And where have you been , Eleonora ?
Eleonora . I went down street and bought these crocuses , and now I must warm them .
They were frozen . Poor dears !
Benjamin . Yes . It_ _s so chilly today , there is_ _n't a=bit of sunshine . Eleonora .
Benjamin . Did you see any birds out=there ? Eleonora .
Yes , flocks of them , starting north for their summer home .
And not one will fall to the earth unless God wills it .
ELIS [ Enters from R . ] . Has the evening paper come yet ?
Eleonora . No , Elis .
[ Elis starts to cross the room -- when he is at C.=Christine enters from L .
No , it has_ _n't come .
[ Christine crosses room and goes out R . , passing Elis , who goes out too .
Neither looks at the other .
] Eleonora . Huh !
Why were they so anxious about the evening paper ?
Eleonora . Do_ _n't you know ?
There will be something in it about --
Benjamin . What ?
Eleonora . Everything !
The theft , the police , and more too -- Mrs .
Heyst [ From R . ] . Has the paper come ? Eleonora .
No , mother dear .
Mrs . Heyst [ As she goes out ] . Let me know first when it does come .
Eleonora . The paper , the paper !
Oh , that the print shop would burn down or that the editor were taken ill , or something -- No , no. I must_ _n't say that .
I must_ _n't .
Do you know , Benjamin , I was with my father last night .
Benjamin [ Surprised ] . Last night ?
Eleonora . Yes , while I slept .
And then I was with my sister .
She told me that she sold thirty dollars' worth of things day before yesterday , and that she had earned five dollars for herself .
Benjamin . That was_ _n't much . Eleonora .
It_ _s a great deal , Benjamin .
Benjamin [ Slyly ] .
And who=else did you meet in your sleep ?
Eleonora . Why do you ask that ? You must_ _n't try to tease me , Benjamin .
You would like to know my secrets -- but you must_ _n't .
Benjamin . Well , then you can_ _n't know my secrets either .
Eleonora [ Listening ] . Can you hear the telephone wires humming ?
Now the paper is out , and now they are ' phoning each=other , " Have you read about it ?
« -- » Yes , indeed I have !
« -- » Is_ _n't it terrible ?
" Benjamin .
What is terrible ?
Eleonora .
Everything .
Think of Elis and Christine .
They love each=other , and yet hate has come between them , so=that when they walk thro' the room the thermometer drops several degrees .
She went to the recital last night and today they will_ _n't speak to each=other .
And why , -- why ?
Benjamin . Because your brother is jealous .
Eleonora . Do_ _n't mention that word .
What do we know about it , for that matter , -- more=than that it is disease and punishment ?
One must never touch evil , for then one will surely catch it .
Look at Elis , have_ _n't you noticed how changed he is since he started to read those papers ?
Benjamin . About the law-suit ?
Eleonora . Yes .
Christine feels this , and not to be contaminated by it , she encases herself in an armor of ice. And those papers -- if I could only burn them !
They are filled with meanness , falsehood and revenge .
Therefore , my child , you must keep away from evil and unclean things , both with your lips and heart . Benjamin .
Do you know something=else that I feel ?
If=Elis and Christine get to know that I bought the Easter lily in that unusual way , they will --
Benjamin . What will they do ? Eleonora .
They will send me back -- _there_ .
Where I just came from . Where the sun never shines . Where the walls are dark and bare . Where one hears only crying and lamentation . Where I sat away a year of my life .
Benjamin . Where do you mean ?
Eleonora . There , where one is tortured more=than in prison . Where the unfortunate dwell , where unquiet reigns , where despair never sleeps , and whence no=one returns .
Benjamin . Worse than prison ? How could that be ?
Eleonora . In prison one is tried and heard , but there in _that_ place no one listens .
Poor little Easter lily that was the cause of all this !
I meant so well , and it turned but so badly !
Benjamin .
But do_ _n't you go to the florist and tell him how it happened .
You would be like a lamb led to the sacrifice . Eleonora .
It does_ _n't complain when it knows that it _must_ be sacrificed , and does_ _n't even seek to get away . What else can _I_ do ?
ELIS [ Enters from R .
No , brother dear .
ELIS [ Turns toward kitchen door ] . Lina must go out and get an evening paper .
[ Mrs .
Heyst enters from R . , Eleonora and Benjamin show fear .
] ELIS [ To Eleonora and Benjamin ] .
Go out for a=few moments . I want to speak to mother . [ Eleonora and Benjamin go out . ] Mrs .
Heyst .
Have you received word from the asylum ? ELIS .
Yes . Mrs .
Heyst . What do they want ?
ELIS . They demand Eleonora's return . -- Mrs .
Heyst . I will_ _n't allow it .
She_ _s my own child -- ELIS . -- And my sister .
Mrs . Heyst .
What do you mean to do ? ELIS .
I do_ _n't know .
I can_ _n't think any=more .
Mrs . Heyst .
But I can .
Eleonora , the child of sorrow , has found happiness , tho' it_ _s not of this world .
Her unrest has turned to peace , which she sheds upon others .
Sane or not , she has found wisdom .
She knows how to carry life's burdens better than I do , better than all of us .
Am _I_ sane , for that matter ?
Was I sane when I thought my husband innocent altho' I knew that he was convicted by the evidence , and that he confessed ?
And you , Elis -- are you sane when you can_ _n't see that Christine loves you , when you believe that she hates you ?
ELIS .
How can I be in the wrong ?
Did_ _n't she go out with my false friend last night ? Mrs .
Heyst . She did , but you knew about it .
Why did she go ?
Well , you should be able to divine the reason .
ELIS . No. I can_ _not .
Mrs . Heyst . You will not .
Very well , then you must take the consequences .
ELIS . That was the last misfortune .
With Christine .
I could carry the other burdens , but now the last support has been pulled away and I am falling . Mrs . Heyst .
Well , fall then -- but land right side up , and then you can start again .
Any news worth reading in the paper ? ELIS .
I do_ _n't know .
I am afraid to look at it today . Mrs . Heyst .
Give it to me , then . I am not --
ELIS .
No , wait a moment -- Mrs .
Heyst .
What are you afraid of ? ELIS .
The=worst=of=all .
Mrs . Heyst .
The worst has happened so many times that it does_ _n't matter .
Oh , my boy , if you knew my life -- if you could have seen your father go down to destruction , as I did , and I could_ _n't warn all those to whom he brought misfortune !
I felt like his accomplice when he went down -- for , in a way , I knew of the crime , and if the judge had_ _n't been a man of great feeling , who realized my position as a wife and mother , I too would have been punished .
ELIS . What was really the cause of father's fall ?
I have never been able to understand . Mrs . Heyst . Pride -- pride . Which brings us all down . ELIS .
But why should the innocent suffer for _his_ wrong-doing ?
Mrs . Heyst .
Hush .
No=more . [ She takes paper and reads .
Elis walks up and down , worried and nervous . ] Ah , what's this ?
Did_ _n't I say that there was a yellow tulip among the things stolen at the florist's ?
ELIS . Yes , I remember . Mrs .
Heyst . But here it says that it was an Easter lily .
ELIS [ With fear ] .
An Easter lily ? Does it say that ?
[ They look at each=other . A long pause . ] Mrs . Heyst [ Sinking into a chair ] . It_ _s Eleonora .
Oh , God keep us !
ELIS .
It was_ _n't the end then .
Mrs . Heyst . Prison or the asylum -- ELIS .
But it_ _s impossible . She could_ _n't have done this . Impossible ! Mrs .
Heyst .
And now the family name must be dragged in disgrace again .
ELIS . Do they suspect her ? Mrs .
Heyst . They say that suspicion leads in a certain direction -- it_ _s pretty plain where .
ELIS . I must talk to her .
Mrs .
Heyst .
Do_ _n't speak harshly to her .
I can stand no=more .
Oh , she is lost -- regained but lost again !
Speak kindly to her . [ She goes out R .
] ELIS [ At door L .
] .
Oh , -- [ Calls ] Eleonora , come out here .
I want to speak to you .
Eleonora [ Coming in , her hair down ] .
I was just putting up my hair . ELIS .
Never mind that .
Tell me , little sister , where did you get that flower ?
Eleonora . I took it from --
ELIS . Oh , God !
[ Eleonora hangs her head , crushed , with her arms over her breast . ]
Eleonora .
But I -- I left money there , beside the --
ELIS . You left the money ?
You paid for it , then ?
Eleonora .
Yes and no. It_ _s provoking , but I have_ _n't done anything wrong -- I meant well -- do you believe me ? ELIS .
I believe you , little sister -- but the newspapers do_ _n't know that you are innocent . Eleonora . Dear me !
Then I must suffer for this also . [ She bends her head forward ;
her hair falls over her face .
] What do they want to do with me now ?
Let them do what they will !
Benjamin [ Enters from L . , beside himself ] . No , no. You must_ _n't touch her .
Do_ _n't believe what he is saying -- it was I .
ELIS .
What shall I believe -- whom shall I believe ?
Benjamin .
Me !
Eleonora .
Me , me !
Benjamin . Let me go to the police --
ELIS . Hush , Benjamin , hush .
Eleonora . No , I_ _ll go -- I_ _ll go .
ELIS . Quiet , children .
Here comes mother .
[ Mrs . Heyst enters R . , takes Eleonora in her arms and kisses her tenderly .
] Mrs . Heyst [ Stirred ] .
My dear , dear child !
You have come back to your mother and you shall stay with me . Eleonora . You kiss me , mother ?
You have_ _n't kissed me in years .
Why just now ?
Mrs . Heyst . Why , because now -- because the florist is out=there and asks pardon for making all this fuss .
-- The money has been found , and your card and --
[ Eleonora springs into the arms of Elis and kisses him .
Then she goes to Benjamin and kisses him quickly on the forehead . ] Eleonora [ To Benjamin ] .
You good child , who wanted to suffer for my sake !
Why did you do it ?
Benjamin . Because -- I -- I -- like -- you so much , Eleonora . Mrs .
Heyst . Well , my children , put on some things now and go out into the orchard .
It_ _s clearing up .
Eleonora .
Oh , it_ _s clearing -- and soon the sun will be shining !
[ She takes Benjamin's hand and they both go out L .
] ELIS .
Mother , can_ _n't we throw the rod into the fire soon ?
Mrs . Heyst .
Not=yet .
There is still something -- ELIS . Is it -- Lindkvist ?
Mrs . Heyst . Yes . He is out=there .
But he looks so queer and bent on talking to you .
Too bad he talks so much and always about himself .
ELIS .
Let him come .
Now that I have seen a ray of sunlight , I am not afraid to meet the giant .
Let him come . Mrs .
Heyst .
But do_ _n't irritate him . Providence has placed our destiny in his hands -- and he who humbleth himself shall be exalted and he who exalteth himself -- well -- you know what happens to him . ELIS .
I know .
Listen -- the galoshes -- squeak , squeak , squeak !
Does he mean to come in with them on ?
And why not ?
They are his own carpets .
[ There are three raps on door R .
] Mrs . Heyst .
Elis , think of us all .
ELIS . I do , mother .
[ Mrs .
Heyst opens door R.=Lindkvist enters , Mrs.=Heyst goes out .
He is an elderly man of serious , almost tragic aspect , with black bushy eyebrows .
Round , black-rimmed eye-glasses .
He carries a stout stick in his hand , he is dressed in black , with , fur coat , and over his shoes wears galoshes that squeak .
] Lindkvist [ After looking at Elis ] .
My name is Lindkvist .
ELIS [ Reserved ] .
Heyst is my name -- will_ _n't you sit down ?
[ Lindkvist sits in chair R. of sewing table -- looks at Elis with a stern eye .
] ELIS [ After a pause ] .
How can I be of service ?
Lindkvist [ With good humor ] .
H'm . Last evening I had the honor to notify you of my intended visit , but thinking it over , and realizing that it was a holy evening , I refrained from coming then , as my visit is not of a social nature -- and I do_ _n't talk _business_ on a holy evening .
ELIS . We are very grateful .
Lindkvist .
We are _not_ grateful . [ Pause .
] However , day before yesterday I made a casual call on the Governor .
-- [ Stops to notice how Elis takes it .
] Do you know the Governor ?
ELIS [ Carelessly .
] I have_ _n't that honor .
Lindkvist .
Then you shall have that honor .
-- We spoke about your father .
ELIS . No doubt .
Lindkvist [ Takes out a paper and lays it down on table ] .
And I got this paper from him , from the Governor .
ELIS .
I_ _ve been expecting this for some time , but before you go any further allow me to ask you a question .
Lindkvist . Go-ahead .
So -- so -- my young man . ELIS .
Young or not , I ask no mercy , only justice .
Lindkvist .
Do you see this paper that I put here on the corner of the table ?
ELIS .
Yes .
Lindkvist .
Ah , -- now I put it back again . [ Puts it back in his pocket .
] Well , then , justice , only justice .
Listen , my young friend .
Once upon a time , I was deprived of my money and in a disagreeable manner .
When I wrote you a courteous letter , asking how much time you needed , you saw fit to answer with an uncourteous note -- and treated me as=if I were a usurer , a plunderer of widows and children -- altho' I was really the one plundered , and you belonged to the plunderer's party .
But as I was more judicious , I contented myself with answering your note courteously , but to the point .
You know my blue paper , eh ?
I see you do .
And I can put the seals on , too , if I choose -- but I do_ _n't , not=yet . [ Looks around the room .
] ELIS . As you please ;
the things are at your disposal . Lindkvist .
I was_ _n't looking at the furniture .
I looked to see if your mother was in the room .
She no doubt loves justice as much as you do ?
ELIS . Let us hope so .
Lindkvist .
Good .
Lindkvist .
Yes ! Yes ! And it is_ _n't too late even now .
ELIS [ Rises ] .
My mother --
[ Lindkvist takes out another paper , also blue , and places it on the table .
Lindkvist . See -- now I put down another paper , and it_ _s blue , too , but as yet -- no seals .
ELIS .
Oh , God , -- my mother !
« As ye sow , so shall ye reap . » Lindkvist .
Yes , my young lover of justice , " As ye sow , so shall ye reap .
" That's the way it goes .
Now , if I should put this question to myself : " You , Joseph=Lindkvist , born in poverty and brought up in denial and work , have you the right at your age to deprive yourself and children -- mark you , _your children_ -- of the support , which you thro' industry , economy and denial , -- mark you , _denial_ , -- saved penny by penny ?
What will you do , Joseph=Lindkvist , if you want justice ?
You plundered no=one -- but if you resent being plundered , then you can_ _not stay in this town , as no=one would speak to the terrible creature who wants his own hard-earned money returned .
" So you see there exists a grace which is finer than justice , and that is mercy .
ELIS .
You are right .
Take everything . It belongs to you .
Lindkvist .
I have right on my side , but I dare not use it .
ELIS . I shall think of your children and not complain .
Lindkvist . Good .
Then I_ _ll put the blue paper away again .
-- And now we_ _ll go a step further .
ELIS . Pardon me , but do they intend to accuse my mother ?
Lindkvist .
We will go a step further first -- I take it that you do_ _n't know the Governor personally ? ELIS .
No , and I do_ _n't want to know him .
[ Lindkvist takes out paper again and shakes it warningly at Elis .
]
Lindkvist . Do_ _n't , do_ _n't say that . The Governor and your father were friends in their youth , and he wishes to see and know you . You see .
" As ye sow , " and so=forth , in everything -- everything .
Will_ _n't you go to see him ?
ELIS . No.
Lindkvist . But the Governor
ELIS . Let us change the subject .
Lindkvist . You must speak courteously to me , as I am defenseless .
You have public opinion on your side , and I have only justice on mine .
What have you got against the Governor ?
He does_ _n't like this and that , what some people would call pleasure .
-- But that belongs to his eccentricities , and we needn't exactly respect his eccentricities , but we can overlook them and hold to fundamental facts as human beings ;
and in the crises of human life we must swallow each=other skin and hair , as the saying goes . But will you go to see the Governor ?
ELIS .
Never .
Lindkvist .
Are you that sort of creature ?
ELIS . Yes .
Lindkvist [ Rises , walks about waving his blue paper .
] That's too bad -- too bad .
-- Well , then I must start from the other end .
-- A revengeful person has threatened to take legal steps against your mother .
ELIS .
What do you say ?
Lindkvist . Go to see the Governor .
ELIS .
No. Lindkvist [ Taking Elis by the shoulders ] . Then you are the most miserable being that I have ever met in all my experience .
-- And now I shall go and see your mother .
ELIS .
No , no. Do_ _n't go to her .
Lindkvist .
Will you go to see the Governor then ?
ELIS .
Yes . Lindkvist .
Tell me again and louder .
ELIS . Yes .
Lindkvist [ Giving Elis blue paper ] . Then that matter is over with -- and there is an end to that paper , and an end to your troubles on that score .
[ Elis takes paper without looking at it .
]
Lindkvist .
Let us sit down . [ They sit as before .
] You see -- if we only meet each=other half-way , it will be so much shorter .
-- No illusions -- as I can_ _not and will not give away my family's common property , I must have what is owing me , to the last penny .
ELIS .
I understand --
Lindkvist . So .
You understand that ?
ELIS .
I did_ _n't mean to offend you .
Lindkvist .
No. I gather as much . [ He lifts his glasses and looks at Elis . ] The wolf , the angry wolf -- eh ?
The rod -- the rod -- the giant of the mountains , who does not eat children -- only scares them -- eh ?
And I shall scare you -- yes , out=of your senses .
Every piece of furniture must come out and I have the warrant in my pocket .
And if there is_ _n't enough -- you_ _ll go to jail , where neither sun nor stars shine .
-- Yes , I can eat children and widows when I am irritated . -- And as=for public opinion ?
Bah !
I_ _ll let that go hang .
I have only to move to another city . [ Elis is silent . ] You had a friend who is called Peter .
He is a debater and was your student in oratory .
But you wanted him to be a sort of prophet .
-- Well , he was faithless .
Lindkvist . Human nature is as uncertain as things and thought .
Peter was faithless -- I do_ _n't deny it , and I will_ _n't defend him -- in that .
But the heart of mankind is fathomless , and there is always some gold to be found .
Peter was a faithless friend , but a friend nevertheless . ELIS .
A faithless -- Lindkvist . Faithless -- yes , but a friend , as I said .
This faithless friend has unwittingly done you a great service .
ELIS [ Sneeringly ] .
Even that . Lindkvist . [ Moving nearer to Elis ] .
As ye sow , so shall ye reap !
ELIS . It_ _s not true of evil .
Lindkvist .
It_ _s true of everything in life .
Do you believe me ? ELIS .
I must , or=else you will torture the life out=of me . Lindkvist .
Not your life -- but pride and malice I _will_ squeeze out=of you . ELIS .
But to continue -- Lindkvist .
Peter has done you a service , I said .
ELIS . I want _no_ services from him --
Lindkvist . Are you there again ?
Then listen !
Thro' your friend Peter's intervention the Governor was able to protect your mother .
Therefore you must write and thank Peter .
Promise me that .
ELIS .
Any other man in the world -- but not him .
Lindkvist [ Nearer to Elis ] .
Then I must squeeze you again .
How much money have you in the bank ? ELIS . What has that got to do with it ?
I can_ _not be responsible for my father's debts !
Lindkvist .
Oh , indeed ?
Were_ _n't you among those who ate , and drank , when my children's money was spent in this house ?
Answer .
ELIS . I can_ _n't deny it .
Lindkvist . Well , then , you must sit down immediately and write a check for the balance . You know the sum .
ELIS [ As=in a dream ] .
Even that ? Lindkvist .
Yes , even that .
Even then it will_ _n't be enough .
Lindkvist . Then you must go out and borrow the rest .
Every penny must be paid .
ELIS [ Handing check to Lindkvist ] . There -- everything I have .
-- That is my summer and my , bride .
I have_ _n't anything=else to give you . Lindkvist .
Then you must go out and borrow , as I said . ELIS .
I can_ _n't do it . Lindkvist .
Then you must get security . ELIS . No=one would give security to a Heyst .
Lindkvist . So .
I will_ _n't have anything to do with Peter .
Lindkvist . Then you are the most miserable creature that I have ever known .
You can by a simple courtesy save your mother's dwelling and your fiancee's happiness , and you will_ _n't do it .
There must be some motive that you will_ _n't come out with .
Why do you hate Peter ? ELIS .
Put me to death -- but do_ _n't torture me any longer .
Lindkvist . Are you jealous of him ?
[ Elis shrugs his shoulders .
]
Lindkvist . So -- that_ _s the way things stand . [ Rises and walks up and down . ] Did you read the evening paper ?
ELIS .
Yes , more is the pity !
Lindkvist .
All of it ?
ELIS . No , not all .
Lindkvist .
No ?
Then you did_ _n't read of Peter's engagement ? ELIS .
No. That=I did not know about . Lindkvist .
And to whom do you think ?
ELIS .
Why should it have been such a secret ?
Lindkvist . Have_ _n't two young people the right to keep their hearts' secrets from you ?
ELIS .
And on=account=of their happiness I had to suffer this agony !
Lindkvist .
Yes , just as others have suffered for your happiness -- your mother , your father , your fiancee , your sister , your friends .
Sit down and I_ _ll tell you a little story .
[ Elis sits , against his will , through this scene and the following .
It is clearing outside . ] Lindkvist .
It_ _s about forty years since I came to this town , as a boy , you understand -- alone , unknown , without even one acquaintance , to seek a position .
All I owned was one silver dollar . The night that I arrived was a dark , rainy one .
As I did_ _n't know of any cheap hotel , I asked the passers-by about one , but no=one stopped to answer .
Took me for a beggar , most=likely .
When I was at the height of my despair , a young man came up and asked me why I was crying -- evidently I was crying .
-- I told him my need , and he turned from his course and took me to a hotel , and comforted me with friendly words .
As I entered the hotel the glass door of a store next door was thrown open and hit my elbow and was smashed to pieces .
The furious owner of the store grabbed me and insisted that I should pay for it , or=else he would call the police .
Can you imagine my despair ?
This man was your father !
So you see , « As=ye=sow,=so=shall=ye=reap . »
And for your father's sake , I have foregone what is owed me .
Therefore take this paper and keep your check . [ Rises .
] And as you find it hard to say thanks , I_ _ll go immediately , and especially as I find it painful to be thanked . [ Goes to door back .
] Go to your mother as=soon=as your feet can carry you and relieve her of her worries . [ Elis starts to Lindkvist to thank him , but Lindkvist makes a gesture toward R . ] Go --
[ Elis hastens out R.=The center door opens and Eleonora and Benjamin enter .
Lindkvist .
Well , little ones , step in and have no fear .
Do you know who I am ? [ In a blustering voice .
] I am the giant of the mountains , -- muh , muh , muh !
-- and yet I am not dangerous .
Come here , Eleonora . [ She goes to him and he takes her head in his hand and looks into her eyes .
] You have your father's kind eyes , -- he was a good man -- but he was weak . [ Kissing her forehead .
] There .
Eleonora .
You speak well of my father ?
Can it be any one wishes him well ?
Lindkvist .
I can -- ask your brother Elis . Eleonora .
Then you do_ _n't want to harm us ?
Lindkvist .
No , my dear child .
Eleonora .
Well , help us then .
Lindkvist .
Child , I can_ _n't help your father in his sentence . I can_ _n't help Benjamin in his Latin .
But everything=else is helped already .
Life does_ _n't give everything , and nothing is given for nothing .
Therefore you must help me , -- will you ?
Eleonora . Poor me , what can I do ?
Lindkvist . What is the date today ?
Eleonora .
Why , it_ _s the sixteenth .
Lindkvist . Good .
Is that all ? Lindkvist .
Oh , you dear child !
But if he neglects these things the giant will come again and say muh , muh !
Eleonora . Why should the giant come and scare children ?
Lindkvist . So=that the children will be good .
Eleonora .
That's true .
The giant is right . [ She kisses Lindkvist's coat sleeve .
] Thanks , dear giant .
Lindkvist .
You should say _Mr .
_ Giant , I should think .
Eleonora .
Oh , no. That's not your real name --
Lindkvist [ Laughing ] .
Good-bye , children .
Now you can throw the rod in the fire .
Eleonora .
No , we must keep it .
Children are so forgetful .
Lindkvist .
How well you know children , little one ! [ He goes out . ] Eleonora .
We are going to the country , Benjamin .
Within two months !
] April , May , June , and the sun is shining on them all . Now you must thank God , who helped us to the country .
Benjamin [ Bashfully ] .
Can_ _n't I say my thanks in silence ? Eleonora .
Yes , you can say it in silence , for now the clouds are gone , and it can be heard up there .
[ Christine has entered from L. and stopped .
Elis and Mrs.=Heyst from R .
Christine and Elis start to meet each=other with loving smiles .
Before they meet -- ]
