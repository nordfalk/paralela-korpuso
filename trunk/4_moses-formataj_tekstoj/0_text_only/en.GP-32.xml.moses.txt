Countess Julie
Characters Countess=julie , twenty-five years old Jean , a valet , thirty Kristin , a cook , thirty-five [ Scene .
-- A large kitchen . The ceiling and walls are partially covered by draperies and greens .
The back wall slants upward from left side of scene .
On back wall , left , are two shelves filled with copper kettles , iron casseroles and tin pans .
The shelves are trimmed with fancy scalloped paper .
To right of middle a large arched entrance with glass doors through which one sees a fountain with a statue of Cupid , syringa bushes in bloom and tall poplars .
To left corner of scene a large stove with hood decorated with birch branches .
To right , servants' dining table of white pine and a=few chairs .
On the cud of table stands a Japanese jar filled with syringa blossoms .
[ Near stove , an ice-box , sink and dish-table .
[ Kristin stands at stork engaged in cooking something .
She wears a light cotton dress and kitchen apron . Jean comes in wearing livery ;
Tonight Miss=Julie is crazy again , perfectly crazy .
Kristin .
So -- you_ _re back at=last . Jean .
I went to the station with the Count and coming back I went in to the barn and danced and then I discovered Miss=Julie there leading the dance with the gamekeeper .
When she spied me , she rushed right toward me and asked me to waltz , and then she waltzed so -- never in my life have I seen anything like it !
Ah -- she is crazy tonight . Kristin .
She has always been .
Yes , what about that gossip ?
He seemed like a fine fellow although he was_ _n't rich !
Ach !
they have so much nonsense about them . [ Seats himself at table .
] It_ _s queer about Miss=Julie though -- to prefer staying here at home among these people , eh , to going away with her father to visit her relatives , eh ?
Kristin .
She_ _s probably shamefaced about breaking off with her intended .
Jean . No doubt !
but he was a likely sort just the same .
Do you know , Kristin , how it happened ?
I saw it , although I did_ _n't let on .
Kristin .
No -- did you see it ?
Jean . Yes , indeed , I did .
They were out in the stable yard one evening and she was « training » him as she called it . Do you know what happened ?
She made him leap over her riding whip , the way you teach a dog to jump .
He jumped it twice and got a lash each time ;
but the third time he snatched the whip from her hand and broke it into pieces .
And then he vanished !
Kristin . Was that the way it happened ?
No , you do_ _n't say so !
Jean .
Yes , that_ _s the way the thing happened .
But what have you got to give me that_ _s good , Kristin ?
Kristin . [ She takes things from the pans on stove and serves them to him . ] Oh , it_ _s only a=bit of kidney that I cut out=of the veal steak for you .
Jean [ Smelling the food ] . Splendid !
My favorite delicacy . [ Feeling of plate ] .
But you might have warmed the plate .
Kristin . You_ _re fussier than the Count , when you get started . [ Tweaks his hair .
]
Jean .
Do_ _n't pull my hair !
You know how sensitive I am . Kristin .
Oh -- there , there !
you know I was only loving you .
[ Jean eats , and Kristin opens bottle of beer .
] Jean .
Beer on midsummer night -- thank you , no !
I have something better than that myself . [ Takes bottle of wine from drawer of table .
] Yellow seal , how's that ?
Now give me a glass -- a wine glass you understand , of course , when one drinks the genuine .
Kristin . [ Fetches a glass .
Then goes to stove and puts on casserole .
] Heaven help the woman who gets you for her husband .
Such a fuss budget !
Jean . Oh , talk !
You ought=to be glad to get such a fine fellow as I am .
And I do_ _n't think it_ _s done you any harm because I_ _m considered your intended . [ Tastes wine .
] Excellent , very excellent !
Just a little too cold . [ Warms glass with hands ] .
We bought this at Dijon .
It stood at four francs a litre in the bulk ;
then of=course there was the duty besides .
What are you cooking now that smells so infernally ?
Kristin . Oh , it_ _s some devil's mess that Miss=Julie must have for Diana .
Jean . Take care of your words , Kristin .
But why should you stand there cooking for that damned dog on a holiday evening ?
Is it sick , eh ?
Kristin . Yes , it_ _s sick .
Miss=Julie has a great deal of pride about some things -- but not enough about others ! Just like her mother in her lifetime ;
she thrived best in the kitchen or the stable , but she must always drive tandem -- never one-horse !
She would go about with soiled cuffs but she had to have the Count's crest on her cuff buttons .
And as=for Miss Julie , she does_ _n't take much care of her appearance either .
I should say she is_ _n't refined .
Why just now out=there she pulled the forester from Anna's side and asked him to dance with her .
We would_ _n't do things that way .
But when the highborn wish to unbend they become vulgar .
Splendid she is though !
Magnificent !
Ah , such shoulders and --
Kristin .
Oh , do_ _n't exaggerate .
I_ _ve heard what Clara says who dresses her sometimes , I have .
Jean . Ha !
Clara -- you women are always jealous of each=other .
I who've been out riding with her -- ! ! !
And such a dancer !
Kristin .
Come now , Jean , do_ _n't you want to dance with me when I_ _m through ?
Jean . Of=course I want to .
Kristin .
That is a promise ?
Jean . Promise ! When I say I will do a thing I do it ! Thanks for the supper -- it was excellent .
[ Pushes cork in the bottle with a bang .
Miss=Julie appears in doorway , speaking to someone outside . ] Julie .
I_ _ll be back soon , but do_ _n't let things wait for me .
[ Enter Miss=Julie and goes to Kristin . ] Julie .
Is it done ?
[ Kristin indicating Jean's presence . ]
Jean [ Gallantly ] .
Have you secrets between you ?
Julie . [ Flipping handkerchief in his face ] .
Curious , are you ?
Jean . How sweet that violet perfume is !
Julie [ Coquettishly ] . Impudence !
Do you appreciate perfumes too ?
Dance -- that you can do splendidly . [ Jean looks towards the cooking store ] .
Do_ _n't look .
Away with you .
Jean [ Inquisitive but polite ] . Is it some troll's dish that you are both concocting for midsummer night ? Something to pierce the future with and evoke the face of your intended ?
Julie [ Sharply ] .
To see him one must have sharp eyes . [ To Kristin ] . Put it into a bottle and cork it tight .
Jean . I do_ _n't wish to be impolite to anyone but -- this dance I promised to Kristin .
Julie . Oh , she can have another -- is_ _n't that so , Kristin ? Will_ _n't you lend Jean to me .
Kristin .
It_ _s not for me to say , if Miss=Julie is so gracious it_ _s not for me to say no. [ To Jean ] .
Go you and be grateful for the honor .
Jean .
Well said -- but not wishing any offense I wonder if it is prudent for Miss=Julie to dance twice in succession with her servant , especially as people are never slow to find meaning in -- Julie [ Breaking out ] .
In what ?
What sort of meaning ?
What were you going to say ?
Jean [ Taken aback ] . Since Miss=Julie does not understand I must speak plainly .
It may look strange to prefer one of your -- underlings -- to others who covet the same honor --
Julie .
To prefer -- what a thought !
I , the lady of the house !
As Miss=Julie commands . I_ _m here to serve .
Julie [ Mildly ] .
You must_ _n't look upon that as a command .
Tonight we are all in holiday spirits -- full of gladness and rank is flung aside .
So , give me your arm !
Do_ _n't be alarmed , Kristin , I shall not take your sweetheart away from you .
[ Jean offers arm. They exit .
] [ Pantomime .
-- Played as=though the actress were really alone .
Turns her back to the audience when necessary .
Does not look out into the auditorium .
Does not hurry as=though fearing the audience might grow restless .
Soft violin music from the distance , schottische time .
Kristin hums with the music .
She cleans the table ; washes plate , wipes it and puts it in the china closet .
Takes off her apron and then opens drawer of table and takes a small hand glass and strands it against a flower pot on table .
Lights a candle and heats a hair pin with which she crimps her hair around her forehead .
After that she goes to door at back and listens .
Then she returns to table and sees the Countess' handkerchief , picks it up , smells of it , then smooths it out and folds it .
Enter Jean . ] Jean . She is crazy I tell you !
To dance like that !
And the people stand grinning at her behind the doors .
What do you say to that , Kristin ?
Kristin . Oh , did_ _n't I say she_ _s been acting queer lately ?
But is_ _n't it my turn to dance now ? Jean .
You are not angry because I let myself be led by the forelock ?
Kristin .
No , not for such a little thing . That you know well enough .
And I know my place too --
Jean [ Puts arm around her waist ] . You_ _re a pretty smart girl , Kristin , and you ought=to make a good wife .
[ Enter Miss=Julie .
] Julie [ Disagreeably surprised , but with forced gaiety ] .
You_ _re a charming cavalier to run away from your partner . Jean .
On=the=contrary , Miss=Julie , I have hastened to my neglected one as you see .
Julie [ Changing subject ] . Do you know , you dance wonderfully well !
But why are you in livery on a holiday night ?
Take it off immediately .
Does it embarrass you to change your coat in my presence ?
Go to your room then -- or=else stay and I_ _ll turn my back .
Jean . With your permission , Miss=Julie .
[ Exit Jean=R.=One sees his arm as he changes coat . ]
Julie [ To Kristin ] .
Is Jean your sweetheart , that he is so devoted ? Kristin .
Sweetheart ?
Yes , may it please you .
Sweetheart -- that_ _s what they call it .
Julie . Call it ?
Kristin . Oh Miss=Julie has herself had a sweetheart and -- Julie .
Yes , we were engaged --
Kristin . But it came to nothing .
[ Enter Jean in black frock coat . ]
Julie . Tres gentil , Monsieur=Jean , tres gentil .
Jean .
Vous voulez plaisanter , Mademoiselle .
Julie . Et vous voulez parler francais ?
Where did you learn that ?
Jean . In Switzerland where I was butler in the largest hotel at Lucerne .
Julie . Why , you look like a gentleman in your frock coat .
Charmant ! [ Seats herself by table . ] Jean .
You flatter me ! Julie .
Flatter ! [ Picking him up on the word . ]
Jean . My natural modesty forbids me to believe that you could mean these pleasant things that you say to a -- such its I am -- and therefore I allowed myself to fancy that you overrate or , as it is called , flatter .
Julie . Where did you learn to use words like that ?
Have you frequented the theatres much ? Jean .
I have frequented many places , I have !
Julie .
But you were born here in this neighborhood ? Jean .
My father was a deputy under the public prosecutor , and I saw Miss Julie as a child -- although she did_ _n't see me !
Julie . No , really ?
Jean . Yes , I remember one time in=particular .
But I must_ _n't talk about that .
Julie .
Oh yes , do , when was it ?
Jean .
No really -- not now , another time perhaps .
Julie .
« Another=time » is a good for nothing .
Is it so dreadful then ?
Jean .
Not dreadful -- but it goes against the grain . [ Turns and points to Kristin , who has fallen asleep in a chair near stove ] .
Look at her . Julie . She_ _ll make a charming wife !
Does she snore too ? Jean .
No , but she talks in her sleep . Julie [ Cynically ] .
How do you know that she talks in her sleep ?
Jean [ Boldly ] .
I have heard her . [ Pause and they look at each=other . ]
Julie . Why do_ _n't you sit down ?
Jean . I can_ _n't allow myself to do so in your presence .
Julie . But if I command you ?
Jean . Then I obey .
Julie .
Sit down then .
But wait -- can_ _n't you get me something to drink first ?
Jean . I do_ _n't know what there is in the icebox .
Nothing but beer , probably .
Julie . Is beer nothing ?
My taste is so simple that I prefer it to wine .
[ Jean takes out beer and serves it on plate .
] Jean . Allow me .
Julie .
Will_ _n't you drink too ?
Jean . I am no friend to beer -- but if Miss=Julie commands .
Julie [ Gaily ] . Commands !
Looking at it in that way you are quite right . [ Opens another bottle of beer and fills glass . ] Julie . Give me a toast !
[ Jean hesitates .
] Julie [ Mockingly ] .
Old as he is , I believe the man is bashful !
Jean [ On his knee with mock gallantry , raises glass ] .
A health to my lady of the house !
Julie . Bravo !
Now you must kiss my slipper . Then the thing is perfect .
Julie . Splendid !
You should have been an actor .
Jean [ Rising ] . But this must_ _n't go any further , Miss=Julie .
What if someone should come in and see us ?
Julie . What harm would that do ?
Jean . Simply that it would give them a chance to gossip .
What did they say ?
Tell me .
And sit down now .
Jean [ Sitting ] . I do_ _n't wish to hurt you , but they used an expression -- threw hints of a certain kind -- but you are not a child , you can understand .
Then what ?
And for that matter , we are not alone .
Kristin is here . Jean . Sleeping !
Yes . Julie .
Then I shall wake her . [ Rises ] .
Kristin , are you asleep ?
Kristin . [ In her sleep ] .
Bla -- bla -- bla -- bla .
Julie . Kristin !
She certainly can sleep . [ Goes to Kristin .
] Kristin . [ In her sleep ] . The Count's boots are polished -- put on the coffee -- soon -- soon -- soon .
Oh -- h-h-h -- puh ! [ Breathes heavily . Julie takes her by the nose . ] Julie .
Will_ _n't you wake up ? Jean [ Sternly ] . Do_ _n't disturb the sleeping .
Julie [ Sharply ] . What ?
Jean . Anyone who has stood over the hot stove all day long is tired when night comes .
One should respect the weary .
Julie . That's a kind thought -- and I honor it . [ Offers her hand . ] Thanks for the suggestion .
Come out with me now and pick some syringas .
Jean . With Miss=Julie ?
Julie . With me .
Jean . But that would_ _n't do -- decidedly not .
Julie .
I do_ _n't understand you .
Is it possible that you fancy that I --
Jean .
No -- not I , but people .
Julie . What ?
That I_ _m in=love with my coachman ?
Jean . I am not presumptuous , but we have seen instances -- and with the people nothing is sacred .
Julie . I believe he is an aristocrat !
Jean . Yes , I am .
Julie . But I step down -- --
Jean . Do_ _n't step down , Miss=Julie .
Listen to me -- no=one would believe that you stepped down of your own accord ;
people always say that one falls down . Julie .
I think better of the people than you do .
Come -- and try them -- come !
[ Dares him with a look . ] Jean .
Do you know that you are wonderful ?
Julie . Perhaps .
But you are too .
Everything is wonderful for that matter .
Life , people -- everything .
Everything is wreckage , that drifts over the water until it sinks , sinks .
I have the same dream every now and then and at this moment I am reminded of it .
I find myself seated at the top of a high pillar and I see no possible way to get down .
I grow dizzy when I look down , but down I must .
But I_ _m not brave enough to throw myself ;
I can_ _not hold fast and I long to fall -- but I do_ _n't fall .
And yet I can find no rest or peace until I shall come down=to=earth ;
and if I came down=to=earth I would wish myself down in the ground .
Have you ever felt like that ?
Jean .
No , I dream that I_ _m lying in a dark wood under a tall tree and I would up -- up=to the top , where I can look far over the fair landscape , where the sun is shining .
I climb -- climb , to plunder the birds' nests up there where the golden eggs lie , but the tree trunk is so thick , so smooth , and the first limb is so high !
But I know if I reached the first limb I should climb as=though on a ladder , to the top .
I have_ _n't reached it yet , but I shall reach it , if only in the dream .
Julie . Here I stand talking about dreams with you .
Come now , just out in the park .
Jean . We should sleep on nine midsummer flowers tonight and then our dreams would come true .
[ She turns , Jean quickly holds a hand over his eye .
] Julie .
What is it , something in your eye ?
Jean . Oh , it is nothing -- just a speck .
It will be all=right in a moment . Julie .
It was some dust from my sleeve that brushed against you .
Now sit down and let me look for it . [ Pulls him into a chair , looks into his eye .
] Now sit still , perfectly still . [ Uses corner of her handkerchief in his eye .
Strikes his hand .
] So -- will you mind ?
I believe you are trembling , strong man that you are . [ Touching his arm. ] And such arms !
Jean [ Warningly .
] Miss=Julie !
Julie .
Yes , Monsieur=Jean ! Jean .
Attention .
Je ne suis qu'un homme !
Julie .
Will you sit Still ! So , now it is gone !
Kiss my hand and thank me !
[ Jean rises .
] Jean .
Miss=Julie , listen to me . Kristin has gone to bed now -- will you listen to me --
Julie . Kiss my hand first .
Jean . Listen to me --
Julie .
Kiss my hand first . Jean .
Yes , but blame yourself . Julie .
For what ? Jean .
For what ?
Are you a child at twenty-five ?
Do_ _n't you know that it is dangerous to play with fire ?
Julie . Not for me .
I am insured !
Jean . No , you are not .
But even=if you are , there is inflammable material in the neighborhood .
Julie . Might that be you ?
Jean .
Yes , not because it is I , but because I_ _m a young man --
Julie [ Scornfully ] . With a grand opportunity -- what inconceivable presumption !
A Don=Juan perhaps !
Or a Joseph !
On my soul , I believe he is a Joseph ! Jean .
You do ?
Julie . Almost .
[ Jean rushes towards her and tries to take her in his arms to kiss her .
] Julie [ Gives him a box on the ear ] . Shame on you .
Jean . Are you in earnest , or fooling ?
Julie . In earnest .
Jean . Then you were in earnest a moment ago , too .
You play too seriously with what is dangerous .
Now I_ _m tired of playing and beg to be excused that I may go on with my work .
Julie . Put those boots away .
Jean .
No , that is my work which it is my duty to do , but I was not hired to be your play thing and that I shall never be . I think too well of myself for that .
Julie . You are proud . Jean .
In some things -- not in others .
Julie .
Were you ever in=love ?
Jean . We do not use that word , but I have liked many girls .
One-time I was sick because I could_ _n't have the one I wanted -- sick , you understand , like the princesses in the Arabian Nights who could not eat nor drink for love sickness . Julie .
Who was she ? [ Jean is silent .
] Who was she ? Jean .
That you could not make me tell .
Julie . Not if I ask you as an equal , as a -- friend ?
Who was she ?
Jean . It was you !
[ Julie seats herself . ] Julie . How extravagant ! Jean .
Yes , if you will , it was ridiculous .
That was the story I hesitated to tell , but now I_ _m going to tell it .
Do you know how people in high life look from the under world ?
No , of=course you do_ _n't . They look like hawks and eagles whose backs one seldom sees , for they soar up above .
I lived in a hovel provided by the state , with seven brothers and sisters and a pig ;
out on a barren stretch where nothing grew , not even a tree , but from the window I could see the Count's park walls with apple trees rising above them .
That was the garden of paradise ;
and there stood many angry angels with flaming swords protecting it ;
but for=all=that I and other boys found the way to the tree of life -- now you despise me .
Julie . Oh , all boys steal apples .
Jean . You say that , but you despise me all=the=same .
No=matter !
One-time I entered the garden of paradise -- it was to weed the onion beds with my mother !
Near the orchard stood a Turkish pavilion , shaded and overgrown with jessamine and honeysuckle .
I did_ _n't know what it was used for and I had never seen anything so beautiful .
People passed in=and=out and one day -- the door was left open .
I sneaked in and beheld walls covered with pictures of kings and emperors and there were red-fringed curtains at the windows -- now you understand what I mean -- I -- [ Breaks off a spray of syringes and puts it to her nostrils .
] I had never been in the castle and how my thoughts leaped -- and there they returned ever after .
Little by little the longing came over me to experience for once the pleasure of -- enfin , I sneaked in and was bewildered .
But then I heard someone coming -- there was only one exit for the great folk , but=for me there was another , and I had to choose that . [ Julie who has taken the syringa lets it fall on table .
] Once out I started to run , scrambled through a raspberry hedge , rushed over a strawberry bed and came to a stop on the rose terrace .
For there I saw a figure in a white dress and white slippers and stockings -- it was you !
I hid under a heap of weeds , under , you understand , where the thistles pricked me , and lay on the damp , rank earth .
I gazed at you walking among the roses . And I thought if it is true that the thief on the cross could enter heaven and dwell among the angels it was strange that a pauper child on God's earth could not go into the castle park and play with the Countess' daughter .
Julie [ Pensively ] . Do you believe that all poor children would have such thoughts under those conditions ?
Jean [ Hesitates , then in a positive voice ] . That all poor children -- yes , of=course , of=course !
Julie .
It must be a terrible misfortune to be poor .
Jean [ With deep pain and great chagrin ] .
Oh , Miss=Julie , a dog may lie on the couch of a Countess , a horse may be caressed by a lady's hand , but a servant -- yes , yes , sometimes there is stuff enough in a man , whatever he be , to swing himself up in the world , but how often does that happen !
But to return to the story , do you know what I did ?
I ran down to the mill dam and threw myself in with my clothes on -- and was pulled out and got a thrashing .
But the following Sunday when all the family went to visit my grandmother I contrived to stay at-home ;
I scrubbed myself well , put on my best dollies , such its they were , and went to church so=that I might see you .
I saw you .
Then I went home with my mind made up to put , an cud to myself .
But I wanted to do it beautifully and without pain .
Then I happened to remember that elderberry blossoms are poisonous .
I knew where there was a big elderberry bush in full bloom and I stripped it of its riches and made a bed of it in the oat-bin .
Have you ever noticed how smooth and glossy oats are ?
As soft as a woman's arm.-- Well , I got in and let down the cover , fell asleep , and when I awoke I was very ill , but did_ _n't die -- as you see .
What I wanted -- I do_ _n't know .
You were unattainable , but through the vision of you I was made to realize how hopeless it was to rise above the conditions of my birth .
Julie . You tell it well !
Were you ever at school ?
Jean .
A little , but I have read a good deal and gone to the theatres .
And besides , I have always heard the talk of fine folks and from them I have learned most .
Julie . Do you listen then to what we are saying ?
Jean .
Yes , indeed , I do .
And I have heard much when I_ _ve been on the coachbox .
One-time I heard Miss=Julie and a lady --
Julie .
Oh , what was it you heard ?
Jean . Hm ! that_ _s not so easy to tell .
But I was astonished and could not understand where you had heard such things .
Well , perhaps at bottom there_ _s not so much difference between people and -- people .
Julie . Oh , shame !
We do_ _n't behave as you do when we are engaged .
Jean . [ Eyeing her ] . Are you sure of that ?
It is_ _n't worthwhile to play the innocent with me .
Julie . I gave my love to a rascal . Jean .
That's what they always say afterward .
Julie . Always ?
What circumstances ?
Jean . Those we_ _ve been talking about .
The last time I -- --
Julie . Silence .
I do_ _n't wish to hear any=more .
Jean . Well , then I beg to be excused so I may go to bed .
Julie . Go to bed !
On midsummer night ?
Jean .
Yes , for dancing out=there with that pack has not amused me .
Julie . Then get the key for the boat and row me out over the lake . I want to see the sun rise .
Jean . Is that prudent ?
Julie . One would think that , you were afraid of your reputation . Jean .
Why not ?
I do_ _n't want to be made ridiculous . I am not willing to be driven out without references , now that I am going to settle down .
And I feel I owe something to Kristin .
Julie . Oh , so it_ _s Kristin now --
Jean . Yes , but you too .
Take my advice , go up and go to bed .
Julie . Shall I obey you ?
Jean . For once -- for your own sake .
I beg of you .
Night is crawling along , sleepiness makes one irresponsible and the brain grows hot .
Go to your room .
In=fact -- if I hear rightly some of the people are coming for me .
If they find us here -- then you are lost .
[ Chorus is heard approaching , singing . ] " There came two ladies out=of the woods Tridiridi-ralla tridiridi-ra . One of them had wet her foot , Tridiridi-ralla-la . " They talked of a hundred dollars , Tridiridi-ralla tridiridi-ra .
But neither had hardly a dollar , Tridiridi-ralla-la .
" The mitten I_ _m going to send you , Tridirichi-ralla tridiridi-ra . For another I_ _m going to jilt you , Tridiridi-ralla tridiridi-ra . " Julie . I know the people and I love them and they respect me .
Let them come , you shall see .
Jean . No , Miss=Julie , they do_ _n't love you .
They take your food and spit upon your kindness , believe me .
Listen to them , listen to what they_ _re singing !
No ! Do_ _n't listen !
Julie [ Listening ] . What are they singing ? Jean .
It_ _s something suggestive , about you and me .
Julie .
Infamous !
Oh horrible !
And how cowardly !
Jean . The pack is always cowardly .
And in such a battle one can only run away .
Julie . Run-away ?
Where ?
We can_ _n't get out and we can_ _n't go to Kristin .
Jean .
Into my room then .
Necessity knows no law .
But think if they found you there .
Jean . I will turn the key and if they try to break in I_ _ll shoot .
Come -- come !
Julie . [ Meaningly ] .
You promise me -- ? Jean . I swear . . .
[ She exits R.=Jean follows her . ]
[ Ballet .
-- The farm folk enter in holiday dress with flowers in their hats , a fiddler in the lead .
They carry a keg of home-brewed beer and a smaller keg of gin , both decorated with greens which are placed on the table .
They help themselves to glasses and drink .
Then they sing and dance a country dance to the melody of " There came two ladies out=of the woods .
" When that is over they go out , singing . ]
[ Enter Julie alone , sees the havoc the visitors have made , clasps her hands , takes out powder box and powders her face .
Enter Jean exuberant .
] Jean .
There , you see , and you heard them .
Do you think it_ _s possible for us to remain here any longer ?
Julie .
No , I do_ _n't .
But what's to be done ? Jean .
Fly ! Travel -- far from here ! Julie .
Travel -- yes -- but where ?
Jean .
To Switzerland -- to the Italian lakes .
You have never been there ?
Julie . No -- is it beautiful there ?
Jean . Oh , an eternal summer !
Oranges , trees , laurels -- oh !
Julie . But what shall we do there ?
Jean . I_ _ll open a first-class hotel for first-class patrons . Julie .
Hotel ? Jean .
That is life -- you shall see !
New faces constantly , different languages .
Not a moment for boredom .
Always something to do night and day -- the bell ringing , the trains whistling , the omnibus coming and going and all=the=time the gold pieces rolling into the till -- that is life !
Julie .
Yes , that is life .
And I -- ?
Jean . The mistress of the establishment -- the ornament of the house .
With your looks -- and your manners -- oh , it_ _s a sure success !
Colossal !
You could sit like a queen in the office and set the slaves in action by touching an electric button .
The guests line up before your throne and shyly lay their riches on your desk .
You can_ _n't believe how people tremble when they get their bills -- I can salt the bills and you can sweeten them with your most bewitching smile -- ha , let us get away from here -- [ Takes a time table from his pocket ] immediately -- by the next train .
We can be at Malmö at 6.30 , Hamburg at 8.40 tomorrow morning , Frankfort the day after and at Como by the St.=Gothard route in about -- let me see , three days .
Three days !
Julie . All that is well enough , but Jean -- you must give me courage .
Take me in your arms and tell me that you love me .
Jean [ Hesitatingly ] .
I will -- but I dare_ _n't -- not again in this house .
I love you of=course -- do you doubt that ?
Julie [ Shyly and with womanliness ] . You !
Say thou to me !
Between us there can be no=more formality .
Say thou .
Jean .
I have never known anyone=else for whom I have such respect . I need only to see his gloves lying in a chair to feel my own insignificance .
I have only to hear his bell to start like a nervous horse -- and now as I see his boots standing there so stiff and proper I feel like bowing and scraping . [ Gives boots a kick ] . Superstitions and prejudices taught in childhood can_ _n't be uprooted in a moment .
Let us go to a country that is it republic where they_ _ll stand on their heads for my coachman's livery -- on their heads shall they stand -- but I shall not . I am not , born to bow and scrape , for there_ _s stuff in me -- character .
If I only get hold of the first limb , you shall see me climb . I_ _m a coachman today , but next year I shall be a proprietor , in two years a gentleman of income ;
Beautiful , beautiful !
Jean . Oh , in Roumania , one can buy a title cheap -- and so you can be a countess just the same -- my countess !
Julie .
What do I care for=all=that -- which I now cast behind me .
Say that you love me -- else , what am I , without it ?
Jean .
I_ _ll say it a thousand times afterwards , but not here .
Above=all , let us have no sentimentality now or everything will fall through .
We must look at this matter coldly like sensible people . [ Takes out a cigar and lights it .
] Now sit down there and I_ _ll sit here and we_ _ll take it over as=if nothing had happened .
Julie [ Staggered ] .
Oh , my God , have you no feeling ?
Jean . I ?
No one living has more feeling than I but I can restrain myself .
Julie .
A moment ago you could kiss my slipper and now --
Jean [ Harshly ] . That was -- then .
Now we have other things to think about .
Julie . Do_ _n't speak harshly to me .
Jean .
Not harshly , but wisely .
One folly has been committed -- commit no more .
The Count may be here at any moment , and before he comes , our fate must be settled .
How do my plans for the future strike you ?
Do you approve of them ?
Julie . They seem acceptable enough .
But one question .
For such a great undertaking a large capital is necessary , have you that ? Jean [ Chewing his cigar ] . I ?
To be sure .
I have my regular occupation , my unusual experience , my knowledge of different languages -- that is capital that counts , I should say .
Julie .
But with all that you could not buy a railway ticket .
Jean . That's true , and for that reason I_ _m looking for a backer who can furnish the funds .
Julie . How can that be done at a moment's notice ?
Jean . That is for you to say , if you wish to be my companion . Julie .
I can_ _n't -- as I have nothing myself .
[ A pause . ]
Jean . Then the whole matter drops -- --
Julie . And -- -- Jean .
Things remain as they are . Julie .
Do you think I could remain under this roof after ---- Do you think I will allow the people to point at me in scorn , or that I can ever look my father in the face again ?
Never !
Take me away from this humiliation and dishonor .
Oh , what have I done ! Oh , my God , what have I done ! [ Weeping .
] Jean . So , you are beginning in that tune now .
What have you done ?
The same as many before you . Julie .
And now you despise me .
I am falling !
I am falling ! Jean .
Fall down to my level , I_ _ll lift you up afterwards .
Julie . What strange power drew me to you -- the weak to the strong -- the falling to the rising , or is this love !
This -- love !
Do you know what love is ?
Jean .
I ? Yes !
Do you think it_ _s the first-time ?
Julie . What language , what thoughts .
Jean . I am what life has made me .
Do_ _n't be nervous and play the high and mighty , for now we are on the same level .
Look here , my little girl , let me offer you a glass of something extra fine . [ Opens drawer of table and takes out wine bottle , then fills two glasses that have been already used .
] Julie .
Where did you get that wine ? Jean .
From the cellar .
Julie . My father's Burgundy . Jean .
What's the matter , is_ _n't that good enough for the son-in-law ?
Julie . And I drink beer -- I !
Jean .
That only goes to prove that your taste is poorer than mine .
Julie . Thief !
Jean . Do you intend to tattle ?
Julie . Oh ho !
Accomplice to a house thief .
Was I intoxicated -- have I been walking in my sleep this night -- midsummer night , the night for innocent play --
Jean .
Innocent , eh !
Julie [ Pacing back=and=forth ] .
Is there a being on earth so miserable as I .
Jean .
Why are you , after such a conquest .
Think of Kristin in=there , do_ _n't you think she has feelings too ?
Julie .
I thought so a little while ago , but I do_ _n't any=more .
A servant is a servant .
Jean .
And a whore is a whore .
Julie [ Falls on her knees with clasped hands ] .
Oh , God in heaven , end my wretched life , save me from this mire into which I_ _m sinking -- Oh save me , save me .
Jean .
I can_ _n't deny that it hurts me to see you like this .
Julie . And you who wanted to die for me .
Jean . In the oat-bin ?
Oh , that was only talk .
Julie . That is to say -- a lie !
Jean [ Beginning to show sleepiness ] .
Er -- er almost . I believe I read something of the sort in a newspaper about a chimney-sweep who made a death bed for himself of syringa blossoms in a wood-bin -- [ laughs ] because they were going to arrest him for non-support of his children .
Julie .
So you are such a -- Jean .
What better could I have hit on !
One must always be romantic to capture a woman .
Julie .
Wretch !
Now you have seen the eagle's back , and I suppose I am to be the first limb --
Jean . And the limb is rotten --
Julie [ Without seeming to hear ] .
And I am to be the hotel's signboard -- Jean .
And I the hotel -- Julie .
And sit behind the desk and allure guests and overcharge them --
Jean . Oh , that_ _ll be my business .
Julie . That a soul can be so degraded !
Jean .
Look to your own soul .
Julie . Lackey ! Servant !
Stand up when I speak .
Jean . Do_ _n't you dare to moralize to me . Lackey , eh ! Do you think you have shown yourself finer than any maid-servant tonight ? Julie [ Crushed ] . That is right , strike me , trample on me , I deserve nothing better . I have done wrong , but help me now .
Help me out=of this if there is any possible way .
Jean [ Softens somewhat ] . I do_ _n't care to shirk my share of the blame , but do you think any one of my position would ever have dared to raise his eyes to you if you yourself had not invited it ?
Jean . Why not ?
Go on , strike me again --
Jean [ Rising ] .
No , forgive me , rather , for what I said .
I do not strike the unarmed , least=of=all , a woman .
On=the=other=hand , I_ _m sorry to have to realize that all that I have looked up=to is not worth-while , and it pains me to see you fallen lower=than your cook as it pains me to see autumn blossoms whipped to pieces by the cold rain and transformed into -- dirt !
Julie . You speak as=though you were already my superior .
Jean . And so I am ! For I can make you a countess and you could never make me a count .
Julie . But I am born of a count , that you can never be .
Jean . That is true , but I can be the father of counts -- if --
Julie .
But you are a thief -- that I am not .
Jean . There are worse things than that , and for that matter when I serve in a house I regard myself as a member of the family , a child of the house as it were . And one does_ _n't consider it theft if children snoop a berry from full bushes . [ With renewed passion ] .
Miss=Julie , you are a glorious woman -- too good for such=as I.=You have been the victim of an infatuation and you want to disguise this fault by fancying that you love me .
But you do not -- unless perhaps my outer self attracts you . And then your love is no better than mine .
But I can_ _not be satisfied with that , and your real love I can never awaken .
Julie . Are you sure of that ? Jean .
You mean that we could get along=with such an arrangement ?
There's no doubt about my loving you -- you are beautiful , you are elegant -- [ Goes to her and takes her hand ] accomplished , lovable when you wish to be , and the flame that you awaken in man does not die easily . [ Puts arm around her .
] You are like hot wine with strong spices , and your lips --
[ Tries to kiss her .
Julie pulls herself away slowly .
] Julie .
Leave me -- I_ _m not to be won this way .
Jean . How then ?
Not with caresses and beautiful words ?
Not by thoughts for the future , to save humiliation ?
How then ?
Julie .
How ?
I do_ _n't know .
I do_ _n't know !
I shrink from you as I would from a rat . But I can_ _not escape from you .
Jean . Escape with me .
Julie . Escape ?
Yes , we must escape .
-- But I'm so tired .
Give me a glass of wine . [ Jean fills a glass with wine , Julie looks at her watch .
] We must talk it over first for we have still a little time left .
[ She empties the glass and puts it out for more .
] Jean .
Do_ _n't drink too much .
It will go to your head . Julie .
What harm will that do ?
Jean . What harm ?
It_ _s foolish to get intoxicated .
But what did you want to say ? Julie .
We must go away , but we must talk first .
That is , I must speak , for until now you have done all the talking .
You have told me about your life -- now I will tell you about mine , then we will know each=other through and through before we start on our wandering together .
Jean .
One moment , pardon .
Are_ _n't you my friend ? Jean .
Yes . Sometimes .
But do_ _n't depend on me .
Julie . You only say that .
And for that matter I have no secrets .
You see , my mother was not of noble birth .
She was brought up with ideas of equality , woman's freedom and all that .
She had very decided opinions against matrimony , and when my father courted her she declared that she would never be his wife -- but she did so for=all=that .
I came into the world against my mother's wishes , I discovered , and was brought up like a child of nature by my mother , and taught everything that a boy must know as=well ;
I was to be an example of a woman being as good as a man -- I was made to go about in boy's clothes and take care of the horses and harness and saddle and hunt , and all=such things ;
in=fact , all-over the estate women servants were taught to do men's work , with the result that the property came near being ruined -- and so we became the laughing stock of the countryside .
At=last my father must have awakened from his bewitched condition , for he revolted , and ran things according=to his ideas .
My mother became ill -- what it was I do_ _n't know , but she often had cramps and acted queerly -- sometimes hiding in the attic or the orchard , and would even be gone all night at times .
Then came the big fire which of=course you have heard about .
The house , the stables -- everything was burned , under circumstances that pointed strongly to an incendiary , for the misfortune happened the day after the quarterly insurance was due and the premiums sent in by father were strangely delayed by his messenger so=that they arrived too late . [ She fills a wine glass and drinks .
] Jean .
Do_ _n't drink any=more .
Julie . Oh , what does it matter ?
My father was utterly at a loss to know where to get money to rebuild with .
Then my mother suggested that he try to borrow from a man who had been her friend in her youth -- a brick manufacturer here in the neighborhood .
My father made the loan , but was_ _n't allowed to pay any interest , which surprised him .
Then the house was rebuilt . [ Julie drinks again .
] Do you know who burned the house ? Jean .
Her ladyship , your mother ?
Julie . Do you know who the brick manufacturer was ?
Jean . Your mother's lover ?
Julie . Do you know whose money it was ? Jean .
Just a moment , that I do_ _n't know .
Julie .
It was my mother's . Jean .
The Count's -- that is to say , unless there was a contract .
Julie . There was no contract .
My mother had some money which she had not wished to have in my father's keeping and therefore , she had entrusted it to her friend's care .
Jean . Who kept it .
Julie .
Quite right -- he held on to it .
All this came to my father's knowledge .
He could_ _n't proceed against him , was_ _n't allowed to pay his wife's friend , and could_ _n't prove that it was his wife's money .
That was my mother's revenge for his taking the reins of the establishment into his own hands .
At that time he was ready to shoot himself .
Gossip had it that he had tried and failed .
Well , he lived it down -- and my mother paid full penalty for her misdeed .
Those were five terrible years for me , as you can fancy .
I sympathized with my father , but I took my mother's part , for I did_ _n't know the true circumstances .
But you became engaged to the Lieutenant Governor .
Julie . Just to make him my slave . Jean .
But that he did_ _n't care to be .
Julie . He wanted to be , fast enough , but I grew tired of him .
Jean .
Yes -- I noticed that -- in the stable-yard !
Julie . What do you mean ?
Jean . I saw how he broke the engagement .
Julie . That's a lie .
It was I who broke it .
Did he say he broke it -- the wretch ! Jean .
I do_ _n't believe that he was a wretch .
You hate men , Miss=Julie .
Julie .
Most of them .
Sometimes one is weak -- Jean .
You hate me ?
Julie . Excessively .
I could see you shot -- Jean .
Like a mad dog ?
Julie . Exactly !
Jean . But there is nothing here to shoot with .
What shall we do then ?
Julie [ Rousing herself ] .
We must get away from here -- travel . Jean . And torture each=other to death ?
Julie . No -- to enjoy , a=few days , a week -- as=long=as we can .
And then to die .
Jean . Die ! How silly .
I think it_ _s better to start the hotel .
Julie [ Not heeding him ] . By the Lake=of=Como where the sun is always shining , where the laurel is green at Christmas and the oranges glow .
Jean . The Lake=of=Como is it rain hole , I never saw any oranges there except on fruit stands .
But it_ _s a good resort , and there are many villas to rent to loving couples .
That's a very paying industry .
You know why ?
They take leases for half a year at=least , but they usually leave in three weeks .
Julie [ Naively ] .
Why after three weeks ? Jean .
Why ? They quarrel of=course , but the rent must be paid all the same . Then you re-let , and so one after another they come and go , for there is plenty=of love , although it does_ _n't last long .
Julie . Then you do_ _n't want to die with me ?
Jean .
I do_ _n't want to die at=all , both because I enjoy living and because I regard suicide as a crime to Him who has given us life .
Julie . Then you believe in God ?
Jean . Yes .
Do you think I would allow myself to be satisfied with such an ending ?
Do you know what a man owes to a woman he hits -- --
Jean [ Takes out a silver coin and throws it on the table ] . Allow me , I do_ _n't want to owe anything to anyone .
Julie [ Pretending not to notice the insult ] .
Do you know what the law demands ? Jean .
I know that the law demands nothing of a woman who seduces a man .
And if I protest against this misalliance ?
Julie . Misalliance !
Jean .
Yes , for me . For you see I have a finer ancestry than you , for I have no fire-bug in my family .
Julie . How do you know ?
Jean . You can_ _n't prove the contrary . We have no family record except=that which the police keep .
But your pedigree I have read in a book on the drawing room table .
Do you know who the founder of your family was ?
It was a miller whose wife found favor with the king during the Danish=War .
Such ancestry I have not . Julie .
This is my reward for opening my heart to anyone so unworthy , with whom I have talked about my family honor .
Jean .
Dishonor -- yes , I said it .
I told you not to drink because then one talks too freely and one should never talk . Julie .
Oh , how I repent all this .
If at=least you loved me !
Jean .
For the last time -- what do you mean ?
Shall I weep , shall I jump over your riding whip , shall I kiss you , lure you to Lake=Como for three weeks , and then -- what do you want anyway ?
This is getting tiresome .
But that_ _s the way it always is when you get mixed=up in women's affairs .
Miss=Julie , I see that you are unhappy , I know that you suffer , but I can_ _n't understand you .
Among my kind there is no nonsense of this sort ;
we love as we play when work gives us time .
We have_ _n't the whole day and night for it like you .
Julie .
You must be good to me and speak to me as=though I were a human being .
Jean . Be one yourself .
You spit on me and expect me to stand it .
Julie . Help me , help me .
Only tell me what to do -- show me a way out=of this !
Jean . In heaven's name , if I only knew myself .
Stay here at home and say nothing .
No=one knows .
Julie . Impossible .
These people know it , and Kristin . Jean .
They do_ _n't know it and could never suspect such a thing .
Julie [ Hesitating ] . But -- it might happen again . Jean .
That is true . Julie .
And the consequences ?
Jean [ Frightened ] .
Consequences -- where were my wits not to have thought of that !
There is only one thing to do . Get away from here immediately .
I can_ _n't go with you or they will suspect . You must go alone -- away from here -- anywhere .
Julie . Alone ?
Where ?
I can_ _not .
Jean .
You must -- and before the Count returns .
If you stay , we know how it will be .
If one has taken a false step it_ _s likely to happen again as the harm has already been done , and one grows more=and=more daring until at=last all is discovered .
Write the Count afterward and confess all -- except=that it was I.=That he could never guess , and I do_ _n't think he_ _ll be so anxious to know who it was , anyway . Julie .
I will go if you_ _ll go with me .
Jean .
Are you raving again ?
Miss=Julie running away with her coachman ?
All the papers would be full of it and that the Count could never live through .
Julie .
I can_ _n't go -- I can_ _n't stay .
Help me , I_ _m so tired -- so weary .
Command me , set me in motion -- I can_ _n't think any=more , -- can_ _n't act -- Jean .
See now , what creatures you aristocrats are !
Why do you bristle up and stick up your noses as=though you were the lords of creation .
Very well -- I will command you !
Go up and dress yourself and see to it that you have travelling money and then come down . [ She hesitates .
] Go immediately .
[ She still hesitates .
He takes her hand and leads her to door . ]
Julie .
Speak gently to me , Jean .
Jean .
A command always sounds harsh .
Feel it yourself now .
[ Exit Julie . ]
[ Jean draws a sigh of relief , seats himself by the table , takes out a notebook and pencil and counts aloud now=and=then until , Kristin comes in , dressed for church .
] Kristin . My heavens , how it looks here .
What's been going on ?
Jean . Oh , Miss=Julie dragged in the people .
Have you been sleeping so soundly that you did_ _n't hear anything ?
Kristin . I_ _ve slept like a log .
Jean . And already dressed for church !
Kristin .
Ye-es , [ Sleepily ] did_ _n't you promise to go to early service with me ? Jean .
Yes , quite so , and there you have my stock and front .
All=right .
[ He seats himself .
Kristin putting on his stock . ] Jean [ Sleepily ] . What is the text today ? Kristin .
St.=John's Day !
It is of=course about the beheading of John the Baptist .
Jean . I_ _m afraid it will be terribly long drawn out -- that .
Hey , you_ _re choking me .
I_ _m so sleepy , so sleepy .
Kristin .
What have you been doing up all-night ?
You are actually green in the face .
Jean . I have been sitting here talking to Miss=Julie .
Kristin . Oh you do_ _n't know your place . [ Pause . ] Jean .
Listen , Kristin . Kristin .
Well ?
Jean . It_ _s queer about her when you think it over .
Kristin . What is queer ? Jean .
The whole thing .
Kristin .
Have you been drinking together , too ? Jean . Yes !
Kristin . For shame . Look me in the eye .
Jean . Yes . Kristin .
Is it possible ?
Is it possible ?
Jean [ After reflecting ] .
Yes , it is .
Kristin . Ugh !
That I would never have believed .
For shame , for shame ! Jean .
You are not jealous of her ? Kristin .
No , not of her .
But if it had been Clara or Sophie -- then I would have scratched your eyes out .
So=that is what has happened -- how I can_ _n't understand !
No , that was_ _n't very nice !
Jean .
Are you mad at her ?
Kristin .
No , but with you .
That was bad of you , very bad .
Poor girl .
Do you know what -- I do_ _n't want to be here in this house any longer where one can_ _not respect one's betters .
Jean . Why should one respect them ?
Kristin . Yes , you can say that , you are so smart .
But I do_ _n't want to serve people who behave so .
It reflects on oneself , I think . Jean .
Yes , but it_ _s a comfort that they_ _re not a=bit better than we .
Kristin .
No , I do_ _n't , think so , for if they are not better there_ _s no use in our trying to better ourselves in this world .
And to think of the Count !
Think of him who has had so much sorrow all his days ?
No , I do_ _n't want to stay in this house any longer !
And to think of it being with such=as you !
If it had been the Lieutenant --
Jean .
What's that ?
Kristin . Yes !
He was good enough , to be sure , but there_ _s a difference between people just the same .
No , this I can never forget .
Miss=Julie who was always so proud and indifferent to men ! One never would believe that she would give herself -- and to one like you !
She who was ready to have Diana shot because she would run after the gatekeeper's mongrels .
Yes , I say it -- and here I will_ _n't stay any longer and on the twenty-fourth of October I go my way .
Jean . And then ?
Well , what'll I look for ?
A married man could_ _n't get a place like this .
Kristin . No , of=course not .
But you could take a gatekeeper's job or look for it watchman's place in some factory .
The government's plums are few , but they are sure . And then the wife and children get a pension --
Jean [ With a grimace ] . That's all very fine -- all that , but it_ _s not exactly in my line to think about dying for my wife and children just now .
I must confess that I have slightly different aspirations .
Kristin .
Aspirations ?
Aspirations -- anyway you have obligations . Think of those , you .
Jean . Do_ _n't irritate me with talk about my obligations . I know my own business . [ He listens .
] We_ _ll have plenty=of time for all this some other day .
Go and get ready and we_ _ll be off to church .
Kristin [ Listening ] . Who's that walking upstairs ? Jean .
I do_ _n't know -- unless it_ _s Clara .
Kristin [ Starting to go ] .
It could never be the Count who has come home without anyone hearing him ?
Jean [ Frightened ] .
The Count ! I can_ _n't believe that .
He would have rung the bell . Kristin .
God help us ! Never have I been mixed=up in anything like this !
[ Exit Kristin . The sun has risen and lights up the scene . Presently the sunshine comes in through windows at an angle .
Jean goes to door and motions .
Julie . I am ready !
Jean .
Hush , Kristin is stirring !
[ Julie frightened and nervous throughout following scene . ] Julie . Does she suspect anything ?
Jean . She knows nothing .
But , good=heavens , how you look !
Julie .
Why ?
Jean . You are pale as a ghost .
Julie [ Sighs ] .
Am I ?
Oh , the sun is rising , the sun !
Jean .
And now the troll's spell is broken .
Julie . The trolls have indeed been at work this night .
But , Jean , listen -- come with me , I have money enough .
Jean .
Plenty ? Julie .
Enough to start with .
Go with me for I can_ _n't go alone -- today , midsummer day .
Think of the stuffy train , packed in with the crowds of people staring at one ;
the long stops at the stations when one would be speeding away .
No , I can_ _not , I can_ _not !
And then the memories , childhood's memories of midsummer day -- the church decorated with birch branches and syringa blossoms ;
the festive dinner table with relations and friends , afternoon in the park , music , dancing , flowers and games -- oh , one may fly , fly , but anguish and remorse follow in the pack wagon . Jean .
I_ _ll go with you -- if we leave instantly -- before it_ _s too late .
Julie .
Go and dress then . [ She takes up bird cage .
] Jean . But no baggage !
That would betray us .
Julie .
Nothing but what we can take in the coupé .
[ Jean has picked up his hat .
] Jean .
What have you there ?
Julie .
It_ _s only my canary .
I can_ _not , will not , leave it behind .
Jean .
So we are to lug a bird cage with us .
Are you crazy ?
Let go of it . Julie .
It is all I take from home . The only living creature that cares for me .
Do_ _n't be hard -- let me take it with me .
Jean .
Let go the cage and do_ _n't talk so loud .
No , I will not leave it to strange hands .
I would rather see it dead .
Jean . Give me the creature . I_ _ll fix it .
Julie . Yes , but do_ _n't hurt it .
Do_ _n't -- no , I can_ _not .
Jean . Let go .
I can .
Julie [ Takes the canary from cage ] .
Oh , my little siren .
Must your mistress part with you ?
Jean . Be so good as not to make a scene .
Your welfare , your life , is at stake .
So -- quickly . [ Snatches bird from her and goes to chopping block and takes up meat chopper ] .
You should have learned how to chop off a chicken's head instead=of shooting with a revolver . [ He chops off the bird's head ] .
Then you would_ _n't swoon at a drop of blood .
Julie [ Shrieks ] . Kill me , too .
Kill me ! You who can butcher an innocent bird without a tremble .
Oh , how I shrink from you .
I curse the moment I first saw you .
I curse the moment I was conceived in my mother's womb . Jean . Come now !
What good is your cursing , let_ _s be off .
Julie [ Looks toward chopping block as=though obsessed by thought of the slain bird ] . No , I can_ _not .
I must see -- -- hush , a carriage is passing .
Do_ _n't you think I can stand the sight of blood ?
You think I am weak .
Oh , I should like to see your blood flowing -- to see your brain on the chopping block , all your sex swimming in a sea of blood . I believe I could drink out=of your skull , bathe my feet in your breast and eat your heart cooked whole .
You think I am weak ;
you believe that I love you because my life has mingled with yours ;
you think that I would carry your offspring under my heart , and nourish it with my blood -- give birth to your child and take your name !
Hear , you , what are you called , what is your family name ?
But I_ _m sure you have none . I should be " Mrs. Gate-Keeper , « perhaps , or » Madame=Dumpheap .
" You dog with my collar on , you lackey with my father's hallmark on your buttons . I play rival to my cook -- oh -- oh -- oh !
You believe that I am cowardly and want to run-away .
No , now I shall stay . The thunder may roll .
My father will return -- and find his desk broken into -- his money gone !
Then he will ring -- that bell . A scuffle with his servant -- then sends for the police -- and then I tell all -- everything !
Oh , it will be beautiful to have it all=over with -- if only that were the end !
And my father -- he_ _ll have a shock and die , and then that will be the end .
Then they will place his swords across the coffin -- and the Count's line is extinct .
Now it is the king's blood talking .
Splendid , Miss=Julie !
Only keep the miller in his sack .
Julie [ Hastening to Kristin and falls in her arms as=though seeking protection ] .
Help me , Kristin , help me against this man .
Kristin [ Cold and unmoved ] .
What kind of performance is this for a holy day morning ?
What does this mean -- this noise and fuss ?
Julie .
Kristin , you are a woman , -- and my friend .
Beware of this wretch .
Jean [ A little embarrassed and surprised ] .
While the ladies are arguing I_ _ll go and shave myself . [ Jean goes , R . ] Julie .
You must understand me -- you must listen to me .
Kristin .
No -- I can_ _n't understand all this bosh .
Where may you be going in your traveling dress ? -- and he had his hat on !
Hey ?
Julie . Listen to me , Kristin , listen to me and I_ _ll tell you everything . Kristin .
Is it that foolishness with Jean ?
That does_ _n't concern me at=all .
That I will_ _n't be mixed=up with , but if you_ _re trying to lure him to run away with you then we must put a stop to it .
Julie [ Nervously ] . Try to be calm now Kristin , and listen to me .
I can_ _n't stay here and Jean can_ _n't stay here . That being true , we must leave -- -- Kristin .
Kristin . Hm , hm !
Julie [ Brightening up ] . But I have an idea -- what if we three should go -- away -- to foreign parts . To Switzerland and set up a hotel together -- I have money you see -- and Jean and I would back the whole thing , you could run the kitchen .
Will_ _n't that be fine ?
Say yes , now -- and come with us -- there everything would be arranged -- say yes ! [ Throws her arms around Kristin and coaxes her ] . Kristin [ Cold and reflecting ] . Hm -- hm !
Julie [ Presto tempo ] .
You leave never been out and traveled , Kristin .
You shall look about you in the world .
Then we_ _ll see his palace -- a palace like those in the Sagas -- and from there it is_ _n't far to Switzerland -- and the Alps , the Alps mind you with snow in mid-summer .
And there oranges grow and laurel -- green all the year round if -- [ Jean is seen in the doorway R. stropping his razor on the strop which he holds between his teeth and left-hand .
He listens and nods his head favorably now=and=then .
Kristin . Listen now .
Does Miss=Julie believe in all this ?
[ Julie going to pieces . ] Julie .
Do I believe in it ? Kristin .
Yes . Julie [ Tired ] .
I do_ _n't know .
I do_ _n't believe in anything any=more . [ Sinks down on bench , and takes head in her hand on table .
] In nothing -- nothing !
Kristin [ Turns to R. and looks toward Jean ] .
So -- you intended to run away ?
Jean [ Rather shamefaced comes forward and puts razor on table ] . Run away ?
That's putting it rather strong .
Now listen to that !
Was it meant that I should be her cook -- Jean [ Sharply ] .
Be so good as=to use proper language when you speak of your mistress .
Kristin .
Mistress ?
Jean . Yes .
Kristin . No -- hear !
Listen to him !
Jean . Yes , you listen -- you need to , and talk less .
Miss=Julie is your mistress and for the same reason that you do not respect her now you should not respect yourself .
Kristin . I have always had so much respect for myself -- Jean . That you never had any left for others !
Kristin . I have never lowered my position .
Let any one say , if they can , that the Count's cook has had anything to do with the riding master or the swineherd .
Let them come and say it !
Jean . Yes , you happened to get a fine fellow . That was your good luck . Kristin . Yes , a fine fellow -- who sells the Count's oats from his stable . Jean .
What's that ?
Jean . And you can_ _n't have respect for your master and mistress any longer -- you , you !
Kristin [ Glad to change the subject ] .
Are you coming to church with me ?
You need a good sermon for your actions .
Jean . No , I_ _m not going to church today .
You can go alone -- and confess your doings .
Kristin . Yes , that I shall do , and I shall return with so much forgiveness that there will be enough for you too .
Do you believe that , Kristin ? Kristin .
That is my life's belief , as true as I stand here . And that was my childhood's belief that I have kept since my youth , Miss=Julie .
And where sin overflows , there mercy overflows also . Julie .
Oh , if I only had your faith . Oh , if --
Who are the chosen ?
Kristin . That is the great secret of the Kingdom=of=Grace , and the Lord has no respect for persons .
But there the last shall be first .
Julie .
But then has he respect for the last -- the lowliest person ?
Kristin [ Continuing ] .
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom=of=Heaven . That's the way it is , Miss=Julie .
However -- now I am going -- alone .
And on any way I shall stop in and tell the stable boy not to let any horses go out in=case any one wants to get away before the Count comes home .
Good bye . [ Exit Kristin .
] Jean . Such a devil .
And all this on=account=of your confounded canary !
Julie [ Tired ] . Oh , do_ _n't speak of the canary -- do you see any way out -- any end to this ? Jean [ Thinking ] . No. Julie .
What would you do in my place ?
Jean . In your place -- wait .
As a noble lady , as a woman -- fallen -- I do_ _n't know .
Yes , now I know .
Julie [ She takes up razor from table and makes gestures saying ] This ?
Jean . Yes .
But _I_ should not do it , mark you , for there is a difference between us .
Julie . Because you are a man and I am a woman ?
What other difference is there ?
Jean . That very difference -- of man and woman .
Julie [ Razor in-hand ] .
I want to do it -- but I can_ _n't .
My father could_ _n't either that time when he should have done it . Jean .
No , he was right , not to do it -- he had to avenge himself first .
Julie .
And now my mother revenges herself again through me . Jean .
Have_ _n't you loved your father , Miss=Julie ?
Julie . Yes , deeply .
But I have probably hated him too , I must have -- without being aware of it .
And it is due=to my father's training that I have learned to scorn my own sex .
Between them both they have made me half man , half woman .
Whose is the fault for what has happened -- my father's ?
My mother's ?
My own ?
I have_ _n't anything of my own . I have_ _n't a thought which was not nay father's -- not a passion that was_ _n't my mother's . And last=of=all from my betrothed the idea that all people are equal . For that I now call him a wretch .
How can it be my own fault then ?
Throw the burden on Jesus as Kristin did ? No , I am too proud , too intelligent , thanks=to my father's teaching . -- -- And that a rich man can_ _not enter the Kingdom=of=Heaven -- that is a lie , and Kristin , who has money in the savings bank -- she surely can_ _not enter there .
Whose is the fault ?
What does it concern us whose fault it is ?
It is I who must bear the burden and the consequences . Jean .
Yes , but -- -- [ Two sharp rings on bell are heard .
Julie starts to her feet .
Jean changes his coat . ]
Jean . The Count -- has returned .
Julie . Now he has seen the desk !
Jean [ Speaking in the tube ] . It is Jean , Excellency . [ Listens ] .
Yes , Excellency . [ Listens ] .
Yes , Excellency , -- right=away -- immediately , Excellency .
Yes -- in half an hour .
Julie [ In great agitation ] .
What did he say ?
In Heaven's name , what did he say ?
Jean . He wants his boots and coffee in a half hour .
Julie . In half an hour then .
Oh , I_ _m so tired -- I_ _m incapable of feeling , not able to be sorry , not able to go , not able to stay , not able to live -- not able to die .
Help me now .
Command me -- I will obey like a dog .
Do me this last service save my honor . Save his name .
You know what I have the will to do -- but can_ _not do .
You will it and command me to execute your will .
Jean . I do_ _n't know why -- but now I can_ _n't either . -- I do_ _n't understand myself . It is absolutely as=though this coat does it -- but I can_ _n't command you now .
And since the Count spoke to me -- -- I can_ _n't account for it -- but oh , it is that damned servant in my back -- I believe if the Count came in here now and told me to cut my throat I would do it on the spot .
Julie . Make=believe you are he -- and I you .
You could act so well a little while ago when you knelt at my feet .
Then you were a nobleman -- or have_ _n't you ever been at the theatre and seen the hypnotist -- [ Jean nods ] He says to his subject « Take=the=broom , » and he takes it ;
he says , « Sweep , » and he sweeps . Jean .
Then the subject must be asleep ! Julie [ Ecstatically ] . I sleep already .
Jean [ Takes razor and puts it in her hand ] .
There is the broom , go now while it_ _s bright -- out to the hay loft -- and -- [ He whispers in her ear .
] Julie [ Rousing herself ] . Thanks .
And now I go to rest .
But tell me this -- the foremost may receive the gift of Grace ?
Say it , even=if you do_ _n't believe it .
Jean . The foremost ?
No , I can_ _n't say that .
But wait , Miss=Julie -- you are no=longer among the foremost since you are of the lowliest .
Julie . That's true , I am the lowliest -- the lowliest of the lowly .
Oh , now I can_ _n't go .
Tell me once=more that I must go .
Jean .
No , now I can_ _not either -- I can_ _not .
Julie .
And the first shall be last -- -- --
Jean . Do_ _n't think .
You take my strength from me , too , so=that I become cowardly .
-- What -- -- I thought I heard the bell !
-- -- No !
To be afraid of the sound of is bell !
But it_ _s not the bell -- it_ _s someone behind the bell , the hand that sets the lull in motion -- and something=else that sets the land in motion . But stop your cars , stop your ears .
Then he will only ring louder and keep on ringing until it_ _s answered -- and then it is too late !
Then come the police and then -- [ Two loud rings on bell are heard , Jean falls in a heap for a moment , but straightens up immediately .
] It is horrible !
But there is no other way .
Go !
